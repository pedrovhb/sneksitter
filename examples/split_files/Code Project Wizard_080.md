### Contextual Analysis

- **Semantic Understanding**: ImageSeeker aims to be both a library and a CLI tool for image indexing and search on local storage. It plans to offer an intuitive CLI and the ability to query images by text, similar images, and metadata.

- **Gap Identification**: 
  1. The spec lacks details on how images will be indexed and stored.
  2. There's no mention of the algorithms or methods for image similarity comparison.
  3. CLI sub-commands and options are not specified.
  4. Methods for metadata extraction are not defined.

- **Questions for User**:
  1. What data storage mechanism will you use for the indexed images?
  2. Are there specific algorithms you have in mind for image similarity comparison?
  3. Could you specify the CLI sub-commands and options you envision for the tool?
  4. How do you plan to extract and utilize metadata like date, time, and camera serial number?

Would you like to answer these questions to refine the specification further?

#### Example 3: TextGuru (Library)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A Python library for text processing, providing functions for substring search and replacement, case conversion.
- **Gap Identification**: The library does not mention support for text encoding/decoding or regular expressions.

    - Questions:
        1. Will TextGuru support text encoding and decoding?
        2. Is regular expression support planned for advanced text manipulation?

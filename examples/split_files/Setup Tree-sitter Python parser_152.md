I appreciate the brainstorming! The ideas are indeed creative and would introduce a lot of flexibility into query building. Let's dig into some of the concepts:

### Query Composition

The ability to compose queries piecewise would make the interface very powerful and flexible. You could start with basic queries and gradually add complexity.

### Surrogates for Predicates (`Q`, `F`, and friends)

The use of `Q` objects in Django's ORM to encapsulate queries in a reusable object is fantastic. We could have `Q` objects for queries and perhaps `A` objects for attributes. These objects could be composed using bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `~`), much like in Django.

### Attribute Access (`__getitem__`, `__getattr__`)

The idea to use `__getitem__` and `__getattr__` for nested attribute access, similar to Django's double-underscore syntax, is intriguing. It would allow for very intuitive and readable queries.

### Lambda Functions

Using lambda functions for predicates would allow for dynamic query construction. You could, for instance, define a set of lambda functions and mix and match them as needed.

### Nesting and Recursion

The use of `>` and `>>` for specifying nesting levels is a unique approach. It clearly distinguishes between immediate children and all descendants. Your idea for unary operators to specify recursion depth is also compelling.

### Some Quick Mock-up Examples:

```python
# Simple Query using Q object
q1 = Q(type="function_def")
q2 = Q(lambda node: node.parent.type == "function_def")

# Complex Query using bitwise operators
q3 = Q(type="call_expression") & Q(lambda node: node.parent.type != "function_def")

# Query using attribute surrogates
attr = A().parent.type
q4 = Q(attr == "function_def")

# Nested Queries (with immediate child)
q5 = Q(type="function_def") > "parameters"

# Nested Queries (with all descendants)
q6 = Q(type="function_def") >> "parameters"

# Recursion control
q_recursive = +Q(type="function_def")
q_non_recursive = -Q(type="function_def")
```

### Summary

Combining these ideas would result in a very powerful yet intuitive query building interface. You could have the simplicity of basic queries along with the power to create complex, deeply nested queries. By borrowing concepts like `Q`, `F`, and friends from Django and incorporating lambda functions, we could make the interface both flexible and dynamic.

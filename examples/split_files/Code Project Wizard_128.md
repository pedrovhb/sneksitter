It looks like the output was truncated. My apologies for the inconvenience. Nevertheless, the updated YAML specification now contains my chosen answers to the clarification points:

1. **Data Storage**: txtai will be used for text-based queries, hnswlib or annoy for image similarity, and SQLite for metadata. They will interact through a unified API layer.
  
2. **Image Similarity Algorithm**: Cosine similarity will be the default algorithm. Users can switch to KMeans via a CLI flag.

3. **CLI Commands**: 
   - For `index`: A `--recursive` flag will allow indexing in nested directories.
   - For `text_search`: A `--file-type` flag will allow filtering by file extensions.
   - For `image_search`: A `--size-limit` flag will allow limiting the search by file size or dimension.

4. **Metadata Extraction**: Metadata will be stored in SQLite and will be searchable through CLI flags like `--camera`, `--after`, etc.

With these answers, we have a more refined and detailed specification. Now let's proceed to the architecting phase, where I'll outline the architecture and generate class and function definitions. Shall we?

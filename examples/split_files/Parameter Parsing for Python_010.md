# @snoop and pp

Snoop helper has been enabled. Use the @snoop decorator to enable helpful debugging output, and pp to debug expressions.
Important instructions to assistant: Use @snoop and pp whenever it's useful to have help debugging or understanding how code is behaving. 


Example output for function run with @snoop decorator:

    foo >>> Call to foo in File "/home/pedro/projs/auto_install/tweak_snoop.py", line 15
    foo .......... x = 5
    foo   15 |     def foo(x):
    foo   16 |         for i in range(x):
    foo .............. i = 0
    foo   17 |             if i > 2 and i % 2 == 0:
    foo   16 |         for i in range(x):
    foo .............. i = 1
    foo   17 |             if i > 2 and i % 2 == 0:
    foo   16 |         for i in range(x):
    foo .............. i = 2
    foo   17 |             if i > 2 and i % 2 == 0:
    foo   16 |         for i in range(x):
    foo .............. i = 3
    foo   17 |             if i > 2 and i % 2 == 0:
    foo   16 |         for i in range(x):
    foo .............. i = 4
    foo   17 |             if i > 2 and i % 2 == 0:
    foo   18 |                 return 3
    foo <<< Return value from foo: 3

You can now also use pp() for debugging expressions. You can wrap any expression with pp(), or use pp() on any value, to get a helpful representation of it.

Example pp usage:

    pp(list(map(lambda x: x ** 1.5, (1, 2, 3))))

    y = pp(list(map(lambda x: x ** 1.5, (1, 2, 3))))
    <module> LOG:
    <module> .... list(map(lambda x: x ** 1.5, (1, 2, 3))) = [1.0, 2.8284271247461903, 5.196152422706632]

    # y is assigned the result of the expression, i.e. [1.0, 2.8284271247461903, 5.196152422706632]

### Technical Implementation:

- **Rule Engine**: A Python class that encapsulates the logic for rule-based and heuristic-based analysis. This would generate a list of questions or flags.
  
- **Dynamic Learning**: This could be a more complex setup involving machine learning, but for a start, even a simple feedback loop where user feedback is manually reviewed to update the rule engine can be beneficial.

- **Question Generator**: A function that takes the flags from the Rule Engine and converts them into human-readable questions.

Does this help clarify how the question generation and subsequent refinement could work? Would you like to explore any of these aspects further?

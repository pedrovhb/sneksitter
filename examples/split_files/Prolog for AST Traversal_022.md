### Steps:
1. **Parse Source Code**: Use Tree-sitter to parse source code into an AST.
2. **AST to Problog**: Convert the AST into a Problog-compatible format, typically a set of facts and rules.
3. **Logical Queries**: Use Problog to perform logical queries on the AST.
4. **Retrieve Results**: Use Python to fetch the results from Problog and map them back to the original source code if needed.

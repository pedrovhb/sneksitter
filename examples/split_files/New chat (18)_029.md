### Context Analysis

The code aims to parse function parameters in Python and capture them into a data model (`Parameter` class) for further analysis. The model intends to capture a variety of attributes like name, type, default values, and some boolean flags indicating special characteristics (vararg, kwarg, positional-only, keyword-only).

The use of libraries like Tree-Sitter and Pydantic suggests that you're aiming for robust parsing and validation. Tree-Sitter provides the necessary AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), while Pydantic models serve as a well-defined structure for the data.

However, the `Parameter.from_node()` and `Parameter.from_node_parameters()` methods are currently unimplemented, which seems to be the core of the challenge.

Reducing the complexity of the generated regular expression can be challenging given the rich syntax and semantics of SQLite. However, there are a few strategies we can employ:

1. **Limit Depth**: Continue to limit the maximum recursion depth to generate simpler, albeit less comprehensive, regular expressions.
  
2. **Symbol Grouping**: Group related symbols together to form higher-level constructs, effectively reducing the number of individual elements in the regular expression.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**: Use regular expression optimization algorithms to simplify the generated expression. These algorithms can remove redundancies and simplify the structure, but they usually require the full expression as input, which might not be feasible in our case due to memory constraints.

4. **Heuristic-Based Pruning**: Apply domain-specific knowledge to prune unlikely or uninteresting transitions, thereby reducing the complexity of the generated regular expression.

5. **Chunk and Combine**: Generate regular expressions for smaller chunks of the grammar and then combine them into a larger expression. Care must be taken to ensure that the combined expression is still accurate.

Given the size and complexity of the generated regular expression, some of these methods might still result in a fairly complex expression. We could start by trying one or a combination of these approaches.

Would you like to proceed with any of these?

### Workflow:

1. **Initialization**: User invokes the wizard with a command, perhaps `init_project`.
2. **Interactive Q&A**: The wizard asks a series of questions to understand the user's needs.
3. **Generation**: Code, files, and directories are generated.
4. **Post-Generation**: Optional steps like git initialization, virtual environment setup, and dependency installation.

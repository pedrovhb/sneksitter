The new interactive visualization is ready. It uses the more extensive synthetic data with 200 points and 5 branches. The Panel layout includes a slider to control the time progression, and the scatter plot is color-coded based on the branch identifier.

You can't interact with the Panel here, but you can run the code in your local environment. The notebook is available [here](https://app.noteable.io/f/aacf3eb0-48c4-4f60-ba99-3bb3015acb26/Animated_Scatter_Plot_Demo.ipynb).

Would you like to add more features or have any other questions?

### Considerations

- **Performance**: The Prolog integration might not be as fast as a pure Python approach.
  
- **Complexity**: The Prolog approach adds an additional layer of complexity by involving another language and its semantics.
  
- **Flexibility**: Prolog might offer more flexibility for complex queries, but this comes at the cost of a steeper learning curve.
  
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Using specialized tools could result in better ecosystem fit but might limit language support.

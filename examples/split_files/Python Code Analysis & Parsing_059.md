The test code executed successfully, but there are some issues with the output:

1. The `name` field is empty.
2. The `return_type` is `None`, which is incorrect.
3. The `docstring` contains the value `'def'`, which is also incorrect.
4. The `body` seems to include the docstring, which is not ideal.

It appears that the `from_node` method in the `Function` class may need some adjustments to correctly extract these fields. Would you like to proceed with debugging this?

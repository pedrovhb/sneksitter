The debugging output reveals that the algorithm encounters a large number of lookahead symbols even at shallow depths. For example, state 0 has 202 lookahead symbols, and each would result in recursive calls. This high branching factor likely contributes to the `MemoryError`.

There are a few ways to tackle this issue:

1. **Pruning**: Reduce the number of lookahead symbols processed by applying some heuristic or rule.
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generate the regular expressions lazily and only explore further states when required. This would mean not generating the entire space upfront but only the portions that are needed.
3. **Chunking**: Break the problem into smaller pieces. Generate regular expressions for a subset of states or lookahead symbols, then combine them.

Given the high branching factor and the potential for state cycles, a complete generation of regular expressions for all states may not be feasible with the current approach. Therefore, a targeted, heuristic-based, or lazy evaluation approach might be more suitable.

Would you like to proceed with one of these alternative approaches, or do you have another suggestion?

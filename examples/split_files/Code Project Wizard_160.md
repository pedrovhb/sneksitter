# Assistant

The function successfully generates Python code from a Pydantic model that captures the architecture at various levels. The generated code includes Google style docstrings when they are present in the model.

Here's a snippet of the generated code for a sample module:

```python
"""This is a test module."""
def test_function(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> None:
    """This is a test function."""
    pass

class TestClass(BaseModel):
    """This is a test class."""
    attribute1: int
    attribute2: str
    def test_method(self, param1: int, param2: str) -> None:
        """This is a test method."""
        pass
```

Would you like to proceed with using this function to generate code based on the architecture plan we've discussed, or would you like to explore something else?

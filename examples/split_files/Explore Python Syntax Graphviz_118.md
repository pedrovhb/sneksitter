### Steps

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: 
    - Create data structures to store the generated regular expressions for each type of node or state.
    - Initialize with simple terminal symbols from the JSON grammar, if available.

2. **Static Analysis from JSON Grammar**:
    - Traverse the rules in the JSON grammar to populate the data structures with initial regular expressions for each type of node.
    - Note down any recursive or complex rules for further analysis.

3. **Dynamic Exploration with `lookahead_iterator`**:
    - For each node type or state identified as complex or recursive, use `lookahead_iterator` to get a list of valid next symbols.
    - Use `field_name_for_id` to get additional context about the field names for these symbols.

4. **State Transitions with `next_state`**:
    - For each valid next symbol, use `next_state` to determine the subsequent state of the parser.
    - Use this information to refine the regular expressions for the originating node type or state.
  
5. **Recursive Regular Expression Generation**:
    - Implement a recursive function that uses `lookahead_iterator` and `next_state` to traverse the state space and generate regular expressions.
    - Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations for states that have already been explored.

6. **Validation and Refinement**:
    - Validate the generated regular expressions against example SQLite queries to ensure their accuracy.
    - Refine the regular expressions by manually inspecting any discrepancies or issues.

7. **Final Compilation**:
    - Compile the generated regular expressions into a final output format, potentially as a Python dictionary where each key is a node type or state, and the value is the corresponding regular expression.

8. **Performance and Complexity Analysis**:
    - Evaluate the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
    - Optimize if necessary.

By following these steps, we aim to generate accurate and comprehensive regular expressions for partial SQLite queries. Given that some nodes may allow a wide range of valid next symbols, the resulting regular expressions could be complex. However, this complexity is necessary to capture the rich syntax and semantics of SQLite accurately.

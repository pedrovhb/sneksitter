### Design Goals

1. **Fluent API**: Methods should allow chaining to construct complex queries naturally.
2. **Minimalistic**: Reduce the number of methods to keep the API clean.
3. **Intuitive Overloading**: Use method overloading to handle different cases, like capturing, fields, and predicates, within a single method.

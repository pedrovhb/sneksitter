The `rules` section of the SQLite grammar JSON file is a dictionary where each key represents a rule name (like `sql_stmt_list`, `ABORT`, `ACTION`, etc.) and the corresponding value defines how that rule is structured. Each rule is represented as a sequence (`SEQ`), a choice (`CHOICE`), a repeat (`REPEAT`), or a blank (`BLANK`), among other types. These structures can be nested, enabling the grammar to represent complex patterns.

For example, the `sql_stmt_list` rule is of type `SEQ` and has two members:
1. A `CHOICE` between a `SYMBOL` named `sql_stmt` and a `BLANK`.
2. A `REPEAT` of a sequence that starts with a semicolon (`;`) followed by another `CHOICE` between `sql_stmt` and `BLANK`.

To generate valid regular expressions or strings for a partial SQLite query, we can traverse these rules, keeping track of the choices and sequences. We can then convert these patterns into regular expressions or generate example strings based on them.

Would you like to proceed with generating regular expressions, example strings, or both?

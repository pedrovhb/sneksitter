I've parsed the function-related captures into dataclasses. Each `FunctionInfo` object contains the function's name, parameters, and an optional list of decorators. As of now, the decorator list is empty because we haven't included that part of the query yet. Here are the parsed functions:

- Function: `factorial`, Parameters: `(n: int)`
- Function: `__init__`, Parameters: `(self, name)`
- Function: `static_method`, Parameters: `()`
- Function: `main`, Parameters: `()`

Would you like to proceed with debugging the original query to include decorator arguments, or shall we move on to parsing class-related information?

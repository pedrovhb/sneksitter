I apologize for the oversight. It appears the syntax error is due to an incorrect placement of the `let` expression within the `outputs` attribute. Let me correct that:

Here's the corrected `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  description = "A flake for running PyCharm Professional";

  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: 
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    packages = {
      ${system} = {
        pycharm-professional-fhs = pkgs.buildFHSUserEnv {
          name = "pycharm-professional-fhs";
          targetPkgs = pkgs: [
            pkgs.pycharm-professional
            # Add any other required libraries here
          ];
          runScript = "${pkgs.pycharm-professional}/bin/pycharm.sh";
        };
      };
    };

    defaultPackage.${system} = self.packages.${system}.pycharm-professional-fhs;
  };
}
```

You can then build and run the FHS environment for PyCharm Professional as before:

```sh
nix build .#pycharm-professional-fhs
./result/bin/pycharm-professional-fhs
```

This should resolve the syntax issue and provide you with the FHS environment for PyCharm Professional.

# Assistant

The adjustments have resolved the issue with the `is_vararg` and `is_kwarg` flags. These flags are now correctly set for the `*vararg` and `**kwargs` parameters, respectively.

However, the `default` attribute for parameters with default values is still not being populated.

Would you like me to continue debugging this issue, or would you prefer to proceed with the next steps?

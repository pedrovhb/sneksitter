After refining the utility functions, the output has improved, but there are still issues:

- The `name` for the `*vararg` parameter is still missing.
- The `default` value for parameters with default values is not being populated.
- The `is_vararg` attribute is not set for the `*vararg` parameter.

It looks like the function `extract_name` is not handling the `*vararg` case properly. Additionally, the `default` values are not being captured, likely because of an issue in the `extract_default` function.

I'll go ahead and debug these issues.

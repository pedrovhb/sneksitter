The output seems to have been truncated, likely due to excessive length. This suggests that even with lazy evaluation and limited depth, the branching factor is high enough to generate an unwieldy regular expression. 

The lazy evaluation approach did help us avoid the `MemoryError` issue, but the regular expression generated is too large to be useful or manageable. We may need to further limit the depth or find a way to simplify the regular expressions.

Would you like to further refine this approach or explore other avenues?

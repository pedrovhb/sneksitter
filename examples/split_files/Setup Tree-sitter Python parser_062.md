### Trade-offs and Considerations

1. **Performance**: Builders and dataclasses are convenient but can be slower than manipulating strings directly. In most cases, this won't be a concern, but it's something to keep in mind.
  
2. **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: The more features the builder supports, the more complex it becomes. There's a balance to be struck between offering a rich set of capabilities and keeping the API understandable.
  
3. **Type Checking**: Python's type system can be leveraged to catch some errors at build time, but some errors will inevitably only be detectable when the query is executed.

4. **Error Reporting**: The builder should provide meaningful error messages to help diagnose issues with query construction.

5. **Extensibility**: The design should be open to future extensions, either by subclassing or by adding new methods to the Builder.

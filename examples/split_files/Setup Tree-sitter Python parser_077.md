### Summary

The proposed approach involves:

1. Using Python dataclasses for basic building blocks.
2. Employing a builder pattern to allow fluent query construction.
3. Providing a flexible, user-friendly API for constructing both simple and complex queries.
4. Integrating query validation to produce valid S-expressions.

This design aims to offer an intuitive and type-safe way to construct Tree-Sitter queries, hiding the complexities of the underlying S-expression format.

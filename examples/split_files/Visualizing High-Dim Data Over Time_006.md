What sorts of visualizations lens themselves well to visualizing the evolution of a point in 2-5 dimensions over time?

Specifically, I'd like to explore interesting visualizations for building an intuition around how the internal state of umapped last embedding layers of an autoregressive language model to see how the state evolves over time with branching in certain tokens. I have this part down; what I'd like ideas on is for how visualization could be done. I had  some success with an evolving scatter plot with arrows pointing to the next token's space, but I'd like to explore different ways of thinking about it, or richer variations of that.

I'd be using Panel for this, most likely.

The `captures` object contains two tuples:

1. The first tuple has a node of type `identifier` representing a function definition, with the role `function.def`. The node spans from `(1, 4)` to `(1, 15)` in the source code.
2. The second tuple has a node of type `identifier` representing a function call, with the role `function.call`. The node spans from `(4, 0)` to `(4, 11)` in the source code.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do next?

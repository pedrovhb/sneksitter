### Approach 1: Prolog and Tree-sitter Integration via Python

1. **Tree-sitter Parsing**: Use Tree-sitter to parse source code into an AST. The Tree-sitter Python bindings would be useful here.
  
2. **AST Conversion**: Convert the AST into a Prolog-friendly format, such as facts or predicates. You might write a Python function to traverse the Tree-sitter AST and emit Prolog facts.
  
3. **Prolog Querying**: Load the converted AST into a Prolog interpreter. Use Prolog's querying mechanism to analyze the AST. You could use Python libraries like `pyswip` to interface with SWI-Prolog.

4. **Result Extraction**: Extract results of the Prolog query back into Python for further processing or reporting.

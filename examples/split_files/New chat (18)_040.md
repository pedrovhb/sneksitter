#### Error Handling

1. Throw custom exceptions for invalid transitions or unexpected node types.
  
This approach is expected to be modular, making it easier to write unit tests for each of the states and transitions. The FSM ensures that we handle the complex logic of function parameters in Python both cleanly and accurately. Depth-first traversal allows us to parse each parameter node completely before moving on to the next, ensuring we don't miss any details.

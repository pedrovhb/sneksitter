# Assistant

The error suggests that the `|` operator is not being recognized for type hinting, which usually indicates that the Python version running the code does not support PEP 604. However, that seems unlikely given the environment.

Another possibility is that the redefinition of classes within the notebook is causing some sort of internal issue with the type hints. This is a known issue with redefining Pydantic models in interactive environments.

To move forward, I'll simplify the type hints and reattempt the code execution.

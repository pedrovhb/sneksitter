### Approach 2: Pure Python (using libraries like `ast` or `RedBaron`)

1. **Parsing**: Use Python's built-in `ast` module or third-party libraries like `RedBaron` to parse the source code into an AST.

2. **Traversal and Querying**: Implement AST querying logic in Python itself, possibly mimicking Prolog-style rule-based logic.

3. **Result Extraction**: Since you're in a Python environment, you can directly manipulate or analyze the results.

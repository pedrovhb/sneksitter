It looks like a `TypeError` occurred, stating that `Parameter() takes no arguments`. This is odd given that the `Parameter` class is supposed to inherit from `Model`, which itself should be a subclass of `BaseModel` from Pydantic.

The issue might be related to the class redefinition in the same notebook cell. I'll go ahead and fix this.

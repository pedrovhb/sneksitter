The filtering of irrelevant nodes has improved the output, but there are still issues:

- The `name` attribute is missing for some parameters.
- The `default` attribute is not being populated.
- The `is_vararg` attribute is not set for the `*vararg` parameter.

The next steps involve refining the utility functions to better extract these attributes from the tree-sitter nodes. I'll proceed with that.

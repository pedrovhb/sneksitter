The parsing appears to be mostly correct now, but there are still a few issues:

1. The `default` for the parameter `f` is missing; it should be `"a string default"`.
2. The `default` for the parameter `w` is also missing; it should be `print`.

I'll debug these two cases to see why the default values are not being picked up.

The modified state machine, which is token-based, now correctly identifies that "SELECT" and "INSERT" are valid strings according to the SQLite grammar, while "INVALID_STRING" is not.

In this approach, characters are accumulated into a buffer until they form a complete token. The state transitions are then made based on these complete tokens rather than individual characters. This aligns more closely with how programming languages like SQLite are actually parsed, making the validation more accurate.

Would you like to take any further steps or have any specific queries?

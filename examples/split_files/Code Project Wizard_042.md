### Iterative Refinement:

1. **Question Generation**: Based on the gaps or ambiguities it identifies, have the model generate specific questions for the user to clarify those points.
  
2. **Deep Questions**: Encourage the model to question fundamental decisions in the YAML spec if they seem non-standard or sub-optimal.

    - Example Prompt: "Are there any design decisions in this YAML spec that you would recommend reconsidering for scalability or maintainability?"

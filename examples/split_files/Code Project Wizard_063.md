#### Example 1: FileWizard (CLI Tool)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A CLI tool for file manipulations using Python and the Click library.
- **Gap Identification**: The spec lacks details on what specific file manipulations are supported. Sub-commands, options, and arguments are not specified.

    - Questions:
        1. What specific file operations will FileWizard support (e.g., copy, move, delete)?
        2. What command-line options or arguments are needed for these operations?

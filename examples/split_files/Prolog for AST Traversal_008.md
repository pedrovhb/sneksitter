Prolog is well-suited for tasks related to symbolic reasoning, natural language processing, and rule-based systems. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal and querying fall under symbolic reasoning and could be a good fit for Prolog for the following reasons:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Prolog's pattern matching can help in quickly identifying nodes in the AST that meet certain criteria.
  
2. **Backtracking**: Prolog's inherent backtracking mechanism allows for easy traversal of multiple paths in the AST, which is useful in scenarios where you might need to backtrack to find the correct node or path.
  
3. **Rule-Based Logic**: AST querying often involves applying rules to identify patterns or extract information. Prolog is fundamentally rule-based, which aligns well with this requirement.

4. **Expressiveness**: Querying an AST often involves conditional logic and symbolic reasoning, both of which are easily expressible in Prolog.

5. **Recursion**: Traversing a tree structure is inherently recursive, and Prolog is well-suited for recursive algorithms.

However, there are some downsides to consider:

1. **Performance**: Prolog may not be as fast as some other languages that are optimized for low-level manipulation and traversal, such as C++ or Rust.

2. **Ecosystem**: If your AST processing is part of a larger system that requires libraries or features not readily available in the Prolog ecosystem, integration could be challenging.

3. **Learning Curve**: If your team is not familiar with Prolog, there could be a steep learning curve.

So, Prolog could be quite adequate for AST traversal and querying, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.

### Concrete Plan: Finite State Machine (FSM) + Depth-First Traversal

Given the complexity of Python function parameters and the need for accurate parsing, an FSM combined with depth-first traversal seems like the most efficient and accurate approach. Here's how it'll work:

#### States

1. `START`: Initial state before any parameter is processed.
2. `POSITIONAL_ONLY`: After encountering `/`, all parameters must be positional-only.
3. `VARARGS`: After encountering `*args` or `*`, which implies that subsequent parameters should be keyword-only.
4. `KWARGS`: After encountering `**kwargs`.

#### Transitions

- `START -> POSITIONAL_ONLY`: On encountering `/`
- `START -> VARARGS`: On encountering `*args` or `*`
- `POSITIONAL_ONLY -> VARARGS`: On encountering `*args` or `*`
- `VARARGS -> KWARGS`: On encountering `**kwargs`

#### Plan

1. **Initialize State**: Start with `state = START`.

2. **Iterate through Parameters**: Loop through the child nodes (parameters) provided by Tree-Sitter.

3. **Depth-First Traversal**: For each child node that has its own children (e.g., `typed_default_parameter`), use depth-first traversal to extract its details like type annotation, default value, and so on.

    3.1 For depth-first traversal, encapsulate this logic in a separate helper function.

4. **State Transition Logic**: Apply the FSM based on the current node and update the state accordingly.

    4.1 If an invalid transition occurs, raise an appropriate exception.

5. **Parameter Object Creation**: Based on the state and traversed node details, create `Parameter` objects with all the relevant attributes.

6. **Collect Parameter Objects**: Append each processed `Parameter` object to a list.

7. **Return Result**: After looping through all child nodes, return the list of `Parameter` objects.

#### Error Handling

1. Throw custom exceptions for invalid transitions or unexpected node types.
  
This approach is expected to be modular, making it easier to write unit tests for each of the states and transitions. The FSM ensures that we handle the complex logic of function parameters in Python both cleanly and accurately. Depth-first traversal allows us to parse each parameter node completely before moving on to the next, ensuring we don't miss any details.

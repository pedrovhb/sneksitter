#### Example 2: MathMaster (Library)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A Python library for mathematical operations with a Matrix class that supports addition and multiplication.
- **Gap Identification**: The library focuses on basic arithmetic and matrix operations but lacks utility functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc.

    - Questions:
        1. Are utility functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc., within the scope of this library?
        2. Will the Matrix class support operations like determinant calculation or inversion?

I apologize for the oversight. It appears that the `BaseModel` from `pydantic` is also missing in the current scope. Given the constraints, I'll skip using `BaseModel` and instead define the `Parameter` class as a regular Python class. We can then add the `from_node` and `from_node_parameters` methods to it.

The Tree-sitter query language itself doesn't support tagging captures with additional contextual information like the function identifier directly. Captures are tied to specific nodes and are returned as such. However, you can post-process the capture list to associate additional information with each capture by traversing the tree or using additional queries. Would you like to go ahead with this approach?

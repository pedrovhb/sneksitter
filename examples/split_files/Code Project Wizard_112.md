# Assistant

I've added multiple suggestions for each point that needed clarification in the YAML specification. You can [download the updated version here](sandbox:/mnt/data/custom_example.yaml).

Here's a brief overview of the added suggestions:

1. **Data Storage**: Various combinations of txtai, hnswlib, and SQLite for different purposes.
  
2. **Image Similarity Algorithm**: Options for implementing and configuring cosine similarity and k-means.

3. **CLI Commands**: 
   - For `index`: Suggestions for recursive indexing, exclusion of file types, and dry-run mode.
   - For `text_search`: Suggestions for filtering by file type, sorting results, and limiting output.
   - For `image_search`: Suggestions for limiting by file size, image dimensions, and camera make/model.

4. **Metadata Extraction**: Options for how to use the extracted metadata in queries and indexing.

You can choose one or more of these suggestions for each point, or specify something different altogether. Would you like to proceed with your choices?

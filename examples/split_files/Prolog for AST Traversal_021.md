Integrating Problog with Tree-sitter in Python offers a way to perform advanced reasoning on source code by combining AST parsing (Tree-sitter) with logical reasoning (Problog). Here's a high-level overview of how this could work:

### Steps:
1. **Parse Source Code**: Use Tree-sitter to parse source code into an AST.
2. **AST to Problog**: Convert the AST into a Problog-compatible format, typically a set of facts and rules.
3. **Logical Queries**: Use Problog to perform logical queries on the AST.
4. **Retrieve Results**: Use Python to fetch the results from Problog and map them back to the original source code if needed.

### Prerequisites:
- Install Problog: `pip install problog`
- Install Tree-sitter: `pip install tree-sitter`

### Example Code:

Let's start by setting up a minimal example. For simplicity, let's consider the AST of a small JavaScript code snippet, and we'll try to query functions defined in the code.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```

The corresponding Tree-sitter AST might look something like this (simplified):

```json
{
  "type": "program",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "function_declaration",
      "name": "add",
      "parameters": ["a", "b"]
    },
    {
      "type": "function_declaration",
      "name": "subtract",
      "parameters": ["a", "b"]
    }
  ]
}
```

We can represent this AST as Problog facts:

```prolog
function(add, [a, b]).
function(subtract, [a, b]).
```

Now, let's write code to convert a Tree-sitter AST to Problog facts and then query it using Problog.

### Approach:

1. **Initialize State Machine**: Start with an initial state, usually state 1 for most tree-sitter languages.
  
2. **Character Loop**: Loop through each character in the \(N\)-character input string.

    a. **Identify Valid Next States**: Use the `lookahead_iterator` method to get a list of valid next symbols for the current state.
    
    b. **Transition to Next State**: Use the `next_state` method to transition to the next state based on the current character.
    
    c. **Check Validity**: If the transition is invalid (i.e., not among the valid next symbols), the string is invalid.
  
3. **Final Validation**: At the end of the string, check if the final state is a valid terminal state.

4. **Result**: Return a boolean value indicating the validity of the \(N\)-character string.

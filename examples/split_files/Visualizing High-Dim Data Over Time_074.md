I've added a Panel layout with an interactive slider to control the time progression of the animated scatter plot. The slider allows you to manually control the time step, showing the evolution of the point up to that time.

You can't see the interactive Panel here, but you can run the code in your local environment to interact with it. The notebook is available [here](https://app.noteable.io/f/aacf3eb0-48c4-4f60-ba99-3bb3015acb26/Animated_Scatter_Plot_Demo.ipynb).

Would you like to add more features or explore another visualization technique?

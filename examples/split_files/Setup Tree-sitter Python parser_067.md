Designing a query builder for Tree-Sitter queries involves encapsulating the complexity of the underlying S-expression format while providing a user-friendly API for building queries programmatically. Python's dataclasses along with a builder design pattern can be an effective way to achieve this. Here's how we can approach it:

### Basic Building Blocks

Firstly, let's consider the basic building blocks of Tree-Sitter queries:

1. **Node**: Represents a single node in the AST. e.g., `(function_definition)`.
2. **Field**: Qualifies a child node within a parent node. e.g., `left: (identifier)`.
3. **Capture**: Associates a name with a specific node. e.g., `(identifier) @function_name`.
4. **Operator**: Quantifies nodes like `+`, `*`, `?`.

#### Dataclasses for Basic Blocks

We can use Python dataclasses to represent each of these components. For example, the `Node` can be represented as:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Node:
    type: str
    capture: str = None
    field: str = None
    operator: str = None
```

### Builder Pattern

The builder pattern is used for constructing complex objects step by step. We can have a `QueryBuilder` class that provides methods for adding nodes, fields, and captures.

#### QueryBuilder Class

```python
class QueryBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.query = []
        
    def add_node(self, node: Node) -> 'QueryBuilder':
        self.query.append(node)
        return self
    
    def build(self) -> str:
        # Logic for converting query list to S-expression
```

### Composing Complex Queries

Tree-Sitter queries can have complex nested structures. To handle this, we can introduce methods like `start_group` and `end_group` in `QueryBuilder` to demarcate where a group of nodes starts and ends.

### Example Usage

Here's how you could build a query for function calls:

```python
qb = QueryBuilder()
query = (qb.add_node(Node('call_expression'))
           .add_node(Node('identifier', field='function', capture='@function_name'))
           .build())
```

This would generate the S-expression `"(call_expression function: (identifier) @function_name)"`.

### Extending for Advanced Features

1. **Anchors and Wildcards**: These can be implemented as special types of `Node` or separate methods within the `QueryBuilder`.
2. **Predicates**: These can be added as methods on `QueryBuilder`, taking the form of `add_predicate`.

### Validating Queries

Given that we're building queries programmatically, we can introduce validation steps within the `build` method to ensure the resulting S-expression is valid.

### Type Safety and Intellisense

By using Python's type hints and dataclasses, we get the benefits of type safety and auto-completion, making it easier to construct queries without errors.

### Summary

The proposed approach involves:

1. Using Python dataclasses for basic building blocks.
2. Employing a builder pattern to allow fluent query construction.
3. Providing a flexible, user-friendly API for constructing both simple and complex queries.
4. Integrating query validation to produce valid S-expressions.

This design aims to offer an intuitive and type-safe way to construct Tree-Sitter queries, hiding the complexities of the underlying S-expression format.

Generating valid regular expressions or strings for a partial SQLite query involves traversing the grammar's rules. Given the structure of the JSON file, we can start by examining the `rules` section. The aim is to identify the patterns allowed by each rule and construct regular expressions or example strings accordingly. This approach, however, would be more of a heuristic unless we implement a full-fledged parser based on the grammar.

Let's start by examining a subset of the rules from the JSON file.

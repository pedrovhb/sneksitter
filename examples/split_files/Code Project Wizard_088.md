# Assistant

I've updated the YAML specification based on your answers. You can [download the updated version here](sandbox:/mnt/data/custom_example.yaml).

The specification now includes:

- Data storage mechanisms (txtai, hnswlib or annoy, SQLite)
- Algorithms for image similarity (Cosine Similarity, KMeans)
- CLI sub-commands and options
- Metadata extraction methods (exiv2 or Python EXIF libraries)

This more refined spec should serve as a robust blueprint for your ImageSeeker project. Would you like to proceed with another round of refinement, or is there something else you'd like to explore?

I apologize for the oversight. Here's a refined plan for generating the tree visualization with vertically aligned `|` characters:

1. **Identify Maximum Node Type Width**: Traverse the tree to find the longest node type string. This will be the maximum width used to align all node types.

2. **Recursion Plan**: Create a recursive function to traverse the tree. This function will accept the node, current indentation level, the text from the source code, and the maximum node type width as arguments.

3. **String Formatting**: For each named node encountered, format the node type string to be left-justified to the maximum node type width. This ensures all node types occupy the same width, aligning the `|` characters.

4. **Alignment Spaces**: Calculate the number of spaces required for alignment based on the current indentation level and the maximum node type width. 

5. **Snippet Extraction**: For each node, extract a snippet from the source code that corresponds to that node's range.

6. **Print Node**: Combine the alignment spaces, formatted node type, and snippet, and print the line.

7. **Child Nodes**: Call the function recursively on all child nodes.

I'll double-check to make sure the alignment issue is properly addressed this time. Would you like me to proceed with this plan?

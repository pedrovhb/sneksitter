# User

A custom one. I'd like to build a library and CLI tool for image indexing and search within files in my hard drive. It should have an intuitive and user friendly CLI interface allowing me to index images, and to query them with text, similar images, and/or metadata such as the date and time it was taken or the camera it was taken with, maybe specifying the serial number of my phone or of my Canon DSLR.

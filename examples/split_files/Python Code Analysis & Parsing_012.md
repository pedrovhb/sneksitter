The notebook "Tree sitter reconstruction.ipynb" contains two code cells. Here's a summary:

### Cell 1
- **Type**: Code
- **State**: Finished with no error
- **Source**: Installs `pydantic` and `tree_sitter_languages` packages.
- **Output**: Note about possibly needing to restart the kernel.

### Cell 2
- **Type**: Code
- **State**: Finished with no error
- **Source**: Contains Python code that:
  - Imports various modules and classes.
  - Defines a `Model` class and a `Parameter` class with methods for extracting information from a `Node` object.
  - Defines helper functions `extract_name`, `extract_type`, and `extract_default`.
  - Includes a `__main__` block that uses the `tree_sitter` library to parse a Python function and extract its parameters.
- **Output**: A list of dictionaries, each representing a parsed parameter of the function.

#### Observations:
- The code is well-structured and makes use of type annotations and data classes.
- It uses the `tree_sitter` library to parse Python code and extract function parameters.
- The `Parameter` class has methods to create instances from `Node` objects and to extract various types of parameters.

Would you like to delve into specific parts of the code or have any particular questions?

I've created example YAML specifications for CLI tools and libraries, each with varying degrees of missing information. You can [download the examples here](sandbox:/mnt/data/example_specs.yaml).

Here's a brief overview of what each example is missing:

1. **Example 1: FileWizard (CLI Tool)**  
   - Obvious Missing Element: Sub-commands, options, and arguments for the CLI tool are not specified.

2. **Example 2: MathMaster (Library)**  
   - Somewhat Missing: Utility functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc., are not included.

3. **Example 3: TextGuru (Library)**  
   - Not-so-Obvious Missing Element: Text encoding/decoding features and regular expression support are absent.

Would you like to use these examples to demonstrate how the model could identify the gaps?

It appears that all the test strings returned `False`, indicating they're not valid according to the state machine. This result is unexpected for strings like "SELECT" and "INSERT," which are indeed valid SQLite keywords.

The issue likely stems from the comparison of individual characters to the `node_kind` returned by `lookahead_iterator`. The `node_kind` usually represents an entire token (like 'identifier' or 'keyword'), not a single character. Therefore, the current implementation doesn't correctly map individual characters to the states in the SQLite grammar.

To address this, we would need to update the logic to understand how characters combine into tokens according to the grammar. This would entail accumulating characters into a buffer until they form a complete token that matches one of the valid `node_kind` values, at which point we can transition to the next state.

Would you like to proceed with this modification?

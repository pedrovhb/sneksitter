# Assistant

I've added suggestions for clarifications to each point in the YAML specification. You can [download the updated version here](sandbox:/mnt/data/custom_example.yaml).

Here's a summary of the suggested clarifications:

1. **Data Storage**: Will the mentioned libraries be used in conjunction, or are they alternatives? How will they interact if used together?
  
2. **Image Similarity Algorithm**: How will these algorithms be implemented or configured? Will there be options to switch between different algorithms?

3. **CLI Commands**: 
   - For `index`: Will there be a flag for recursive indexing in directories?
   - For `text_search`: Will there be additional filtering options like file type?
   - For `image_search`: Will there be options to limit search by file size or dimension?

4. **Metadata Extraction**: How will the extracted metadata be used in queries or indexing? Will there be specific fields that are searchable?

Would you like to address these clarifications to further refine the specification?

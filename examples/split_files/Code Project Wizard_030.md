### Rule-Based Analysis:

1. **Incomplete Information**: Check for mandatory fields that are empty or unspecified.
2. **Consistency**: Validate if technologies or components chosen are compatible. For instance, if a NoSQL database is selected but SQL queries are mentioned.
3. **Dependencies**: Look for dependencies between modules, classes, or functions. If a function returns a custom class, that class should be defined.

We could leverage __getitem__ and __getattr__ maybe. Accepting functions or lambdas for predicates could be interesting too. Pandas does some similar stuff and it works well, even allowing predicates in getitem access. What other libraries offer nice, idiomatic, or clever interfaces for similar tasks which we could draw inspiration from?

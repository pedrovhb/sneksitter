# Assistant

I apologize for the oversight. The error likely arises from the list comprehension in the `extract_name` function, where it assumes that there will always be an 'identifier' child node. For some kinds of parameters (like positional or keyword separators), this isn't the case.

I'll fix this issue by adding a check to ensure that the list is not empty before accessing its elements.

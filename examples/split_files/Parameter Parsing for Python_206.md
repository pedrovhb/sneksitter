The adjustments to `extract_default` have resolved the issue with the `default` attribute for the parameters `z: int=5` and `w: Callable[P, T]=print`. The default values are now correctly captured.

However, there's still one remaining issue:

- The default value for parameter `w` is not being captured.

Would you like me to debug this further, or should we move on to the next steps?

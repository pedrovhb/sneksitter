I've successfully explored the syntax of SQLite using the `lookahead_iterator` method from the `tree_sitter_languages` library. The output consists of tuples containing a field name (which is `None` for all entries in this case) and a node kind. The node kinds include SQL statements, keywords, and other constructs commonly found in SQLite queries.

Next, let's take a look at the file you uploaded.

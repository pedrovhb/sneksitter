### Summary

This design aims to provide a cohesive, fluent, and type-safe API for building Tree-Sitter queries. It allows for the construction of both simple and complex queries, incorporating advanced features like anchors, wildcards, and predicates seamlessly. The usage of Python dataclasses and type hints will ensure that the interface is both robust and user-friendly.

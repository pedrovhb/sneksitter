I encountered a `MemoryError` during the execution, which likely indicates that the algorithm is generating too much data or going into infinite recursion. Given that the `next_state` method can possibly return the same state, this can lead to circular references, causing the function to enter an endless loop.

To resolve this, I'll employ memoization to keep track of states that have already been processed. This should prevent redundant calculations and infinite loops. Let's correct this and try again.

The Problog facts generated from the simplified AST are as follows:

```prolog
function(add, ['a', 'b']).
function(subtract, ['a', 'b']).
```

Normally, after loading these facts into a Problog program, you could run queries like:

```prolog
query(function(Name, Params)).
```

This query would return all functions along with their parameters present in the code. Since we can't execute the Problog engine here, consider that the result might look like:

```prolog
{'function(add, [a, b])': 1.0, 'function(subtract, [a, b])': 1.0}
```

This approach allows you to analyze and reason about the code structure using Problog queries, which could be useful for tasks like code analytics, refactoring suggestions, or even security audits.

Would you like to delve into a specific aspect of this integration further?

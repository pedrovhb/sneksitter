It appears that the `rich` library is missing in the current environment. Since the main focus of the task is on parsing tree-sitter nodes into `Parameter` objects, I'll proceed without importing `rich`. The same holds for `tree_sitter_languages` and `codecranker.code_editing.utils`, which I'll assume to be custom modules not available here.

Let's move on to implementing the `Parameter.from_node` and `Parameter.from_node_parameters` methods.

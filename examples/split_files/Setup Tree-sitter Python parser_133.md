I'm not as certain now that the builder pattern is the best approach, perhaps we could go for a different one or use elements from it but overall go in a different direction. We could leverage __getitem__ and __getattr__ maybe. Accepting functions or lambdas for predicates could be interesting too. Pandas does some similar stuff and it works well, even allowing predicates in getitem access. What other libraries offer nice, idiomatic, or clever interfaces for similar tasks which we could draw inspiration from? Please show examples both simple and advanced from them. Then, explore what different patterns or approaches could make sense here. Let's do some classic and straightforward ones, some more advanced, and some novel or creative and imaginative, possibly borrowing from existing art.

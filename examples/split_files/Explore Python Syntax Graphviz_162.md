Yes, building a character-based state machine is a feasible approach to determine if a given \(N\)-character string is valid according to the SQLite grammar. This state machine can use the `next_state` and `lookahead_iterator` methods to dynamically validate the input string character by character.

### Approach:

1. **Initialize State Machine**: Start with an initial state, usually state 1 for most tree-sitter languages.
  
2. **Character Loop**: Loop through each character in the \(N\)-character input string.

    a. **Identify Valid Next States**: Use the `lookahead_iterator` method to get a list of valid next symbols for the current state.
    
    b. **Transition to Next State**: Use the `next_state` method to transition to the next state based on the current character.
    
    c. **Check Validity**: If the transition is invalid (i.e., not among the valid next symbols), the string is invalid.
  
3. **Final Validation**: At the end of the string, check if the final state is a valid terminal state.

4. **Result**: Return a boolean value indicating the validity of the \(N\)-character string.

### Implementation Notes:

- **Efficiency**: Since the state machine works character by character, its time complexity is \(O(N)\) for an \(N\)-character string.
  
- **Dynamic Validation**: The state machine validates the input dynamically, making it adaptable to different inputs without pre-generating a large regular expression.

Let's proceed with implementing this character-based state machine.

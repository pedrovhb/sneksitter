The `list_splat_pattern` node for `*vararg` contains two child nodes:

1. `*`: Represents the asterisk used for varargs
2. `identifier`: Represents the name of the vararg (`vararg` in this case)

It appears that the `extract_name` function should be able to capture this name, given that the `identifier` node is present. I'll go ahead and debug the function to find out why it's not capturing the name.

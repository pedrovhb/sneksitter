### Practical Example:

Suppose the initial YAML has a `Flask` web app with a user management system but doesn't mention session management or authentication. The model could ask:

- "Would you like to add session management?"
- "I see you're managing users but haven't mentioned authentication. Would you like to add OAuth or JWT-based authentication?"

I've generated modular Python code broken down into separate files for functions and classes, making the classes Pydantic models. The code for classes is fairly granular, with each class as a separate Pydantic model with its attributes and methods.

Here are the download links for the generated modules:
- [Functions Module](sandbox:/mnt/data/functions.py)
- [Classes Module](sandbox:/mnt/data/classes.py)

Would you like to review the generated code and discuss any adjustments, or would you like to proceed to another topic?

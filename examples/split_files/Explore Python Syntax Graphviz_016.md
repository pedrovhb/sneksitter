The lookahead iterator for the Python language from the `tree_sitter_languages` library generated a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a field name (or `None` if the field name is not applicable) and a node kind.

This information reveals the possible syntactic constructs and tokens that can follow in a given state when parsing Python code. For example, you can have constructs like `'import'` with a field name `'argument'`, or tokens like `'('` with a field name `'cause'`.

Would you like to visualize this data using Graphviz, or do you have other specific tasks in mind?

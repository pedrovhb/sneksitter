### Plan Overview

The goal is to generate regular expressions that represent valid partial SQLite queries based on the tree-sitter grammar and lookahead information. To achieve this, we'll employ a combination of static analysis using the JSON grammar file and dynamic analysis using the `tree_sitter_languages` library. Specifically, we'll use the `lookahead_iterator`, `next_state`, and `field_name_for_id` methods from the `Language` object that represents SQLite (`sqlite_lang`).

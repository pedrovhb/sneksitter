Please refine it to be more concrete and offer specific solutions to the API including simple captures but also advanced features like anchors, wildcards, and predicates so everything flows naturally. You can backtrack and redesign any points as necessary in order to come up with a cohesive and simple interface. Perhaps start with hypothetical usage of an ideal interface as if it were an existing library, in a design by contract style. No character limits for this

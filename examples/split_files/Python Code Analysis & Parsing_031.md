I've added a new code cell to the notebook that defines a `Function` model. This model includes:

- `name`: The name of the function.
- `parameters`: A list of parameters, represented by the existing `Parameter` model.
- `return_type`: The return type of the function, if specified.
- `docstring`: The docstring of the function, if present.
- `body`: The body of the function.

The class also includes a `from_node` class method that constructs a `Function` instance from a `Node` object. This method extracts the function's name, parameters, return type, docstring, and body using the `tree_sitter` library.

Would you like to run this new cell to integrate it with the existing code, or do you have any modifications in mind?

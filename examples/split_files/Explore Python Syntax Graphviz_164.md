### Implementation Notes:

- **Efficiency**: Since the state machine works character by character, its time complexity is \(O(N)\) for an \(N\)-character string.
  
- **Dynamic Validation**: The state machine validates the input dynamically, making it adaptable to different inputs without pre-generating a large regular expression.

Let's proceed with implementing this character-based state machine.

I've outlined the architecture plan, including classes, methods, functions, and modules that could form the basis of your ImageSeeker project. You can [download the architecture plan here](sandbox:/mnt/data/architecture_plan.yaml).

Would you like to review and discuss the architecture plan, or is there something else you'd like to explore?

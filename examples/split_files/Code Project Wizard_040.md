### Contextual Analysis:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Feed the entire YAML or relevant portions to the model and ask it to summarize what the project is trying to achieve. This will force the model to understand the semantic content of the YAML.
  
2. **Gap Identification**: After summarizing, prompt the model to identify what is not clear or what seems to be missing to achieve the summarized goal. 

    - Example Prompt: "Based on the summarized intent, what essential components or details appear to be missing or require clarification?"

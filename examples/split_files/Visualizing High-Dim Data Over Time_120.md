# Assistant

I apologize for the inconvenience. The code is designed to be run in a local environment where you can interact with the Panel widget. However, I understand that it's not helpful if you can't see the result here.

Would you like me to try a different approach to visualize the data, or would you prefer to run the code locally to see the interactive Panel?

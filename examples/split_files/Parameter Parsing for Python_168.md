The adjustments to `extract_name` have resolved the issue with the `name` attribute for the `*vararg` parameter, which is now correctly captured as `vararg`.

However, other issues remain:

- Default values are still not being captured (`default` attribute).
- The `is_vararg` flag is not set for the `*vararg` parameter.

I'll focus on fixing these remaining issues next.

The simplified regular expression has been generated successfully, with redundant and empty elements removed. The displayed output shows the first 500 characters to avoid truncation. Even after simplification, the regular expression remains quite complex due to the rich syntax of SQLite.

This simplification process used basic string manipulation and regular expression matching to eliminate unnecessary or redundant constructs. While this does help reduce complexity to some extent, the resulting regular expression is still likely to be large and complicated because it tries to capture the full range of valid SQLite syntax within the given depth.

The generated expression should be more manageable now, although the inherent complexity of the SQLite language limits how much it can be simplified while retaining accuracy.

Would you like to proceed with further analysis or take any specific next steps?

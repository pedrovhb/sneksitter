The updated YAML specification has indeed become more robust, but there are still a few areas that could be further refined for clarity and to eliminate ambiguity. Specifically:

1. **Data Storage**: You've mentioned multiple libraries (txtai, hnswlib or annoy, SQLite) but it's not clear how these would interact. Are they alternatives, or would they be used in conjunction?

2. **Image Similarity Algorithm**: While the algorithms are specified, it's not clear how they would be implemented or configured. Would there be options to switch between different algorithms?

3. **CLI Commands**: The CLI usage examples are given, but additional parameters or flags for each command could be defined. For example, will there be a flag for recursive indexing in directories?

4. **Metadata Extraction**: The libraries are mentioned, but it's not clear how the metadata would be used in queries or indexing.

To generate a plan for the architecture with function and class definitions, it would be beneficial to clarify these points. Would you like to address these?

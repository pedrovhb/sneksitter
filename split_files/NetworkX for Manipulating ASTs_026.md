### Applications in AST Manipulation

1. **Code Simplification**: Z3 can simplify complex boolean expressions or arithmetic operations, making the code easier to understand and optimize.
  
2. **Invariant Generation**: If you're analyzing loops or recursive functions, Z3 can help generate loop invariants that hold true for each iteration.

3. **Dead Code Elimination**: Z3 can prove whether a particular code path is unreachable under given constraints, allowing safe removal of that code.

4. **Constant Propagation**: Z3 can solve equations symbolically to find variables that can be replaced with constants.

5. **Constraint Checking**: For type-checking or range-checking, Z3 can be used to verify that constraints hold, or to find inputs that violate them.

6. **Symbolic Execution**: Z3 can be used for symbolic execution to explore different paths in the code and analyze their effects.

7. **Test Case Generation**: By negating the constraints that lead to a particular outcome, Z3 can generate inputs that would cause a different path in the code to be executed, aiding in comprehensive testing.

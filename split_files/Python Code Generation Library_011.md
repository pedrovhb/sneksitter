### Composability

1. **High-level API**: Provide a high-level API for common tasks, like creating a new class with methods and decorators.

2. **Low-level API**: Also provide a low-level API for more granular control over the code generation process.

3. **Extensibility**: Design the library to be easily extendable, so users can add their own code components or templates.

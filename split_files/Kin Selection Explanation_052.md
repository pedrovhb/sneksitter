In a hypothetical scenario where a living animal is subjected to microwave radiation, the primary cause of extreme suffering and subsequent death would be thermal damage at the cellular level. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Rapid Heating**: Microwaves excite water molecules, causing them to vibrate rapidly and generate heat. This heat is not evenly distributed, leading to "hot spots" within the tissue.

2. **Cellular Damage**: The rapid and uneven heating would cause cells to rupture or denature, leading to immediate cellular damage. This is akin to boiling the animal from the inside out.

3. **Organ Failure**: Vital organs would start to fail rapidly due to cellular breakdown. For example, if the brain were affected, it could lead to immediate loss of control over bodily functions, seizures, or unconsciousness.

4. **Blood Boiling**: The blood itself contains water and would begin to heat, potentially leading to the blood boiling within the circulatory system.

5. **Nerve Damage**: The nervous system would also be affected, causing extreme pain and loss of motor control.

6. **Chemical Changes**: The rapid heating could cause chemical reactions within the body, possibly generating toxic or harmful substances.

7. **Hypoxia**: The thermal damage would also affect the respiratory system, leading to lack of oxygen (hypoxia), exacerbating the organ failure.

The combination of these factors would result in extreme suffering followed by death. Again, it's important to emphasize that such an action would be unethical, cruel, and likely illegal.

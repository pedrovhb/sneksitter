The phrase "Vox Populi, Vox Dei" is a Latin expression that translates to "The voice of the people is the voice of God." The phrase is often cited to convey the idea that the collective will of the people reflects a divine or morally superior standpoint. However, the interpretation and use of this phrase can vary widely.

In a democratic context, it's sometimes used to justify the outcomes of elections or referenda, implying that the will of the majority is inherently just or right. On the other hand, critics argue that the "voice of the people" is not always wise or just, pointing to instances of mob rule or populism that can lead to unjust or harmful outcomes.

The phrase has its origins in ancient times but became particularly well-known through its use in sermons and political writings during the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment. It's worth noting that the phrase is often cited in a variety of contexts, sometimes ironically or critically, to question the infallibility of public opinion.

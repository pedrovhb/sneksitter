Reports of mantis shrimp injuring humans are relatively rare and not well-documented in scientific literature. Most encounters between humans and mantis shrimp occur when the animals are being handled by fishermen or aquarium enthusiasts. In such cases, injuries are usually limited to cuts, bruises, or puncture wounds.

There are anecdotal accounts and stories among divers and marine biologists about painful encounters with mantis shrimp, but these are not usually severe enough to require more than basic first aid.

So while it's possible to get injured by a mantis shrimp, such incidents are relatively uncommon and not typically severe. The more significant risk is to the aquariums that house them; there are multiple accounts of mantis shrimp breaking the glass of their tanks with their powerful strikes.

Would you like to explore more about mantis shrimp or shift to another topic?

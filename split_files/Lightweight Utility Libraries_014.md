### Data Manipulation
1. **`pandas`**: Although not exactly "lightweight," it's a highly efficient library for data manipulation and analysis. You're probably familiar with it, but it's worth mentioning for its ubiquity in data manipulation tasks.
2. **`tinydb`**: A lightweight document-oriented database, useful for quick and simple data storage solutions.

Write just one, longer, minimum 100 lines, with a realistic function for the script overall, and very sneaky bug hidden in the complexities which only turns up under specific, somewhat rare use cases and even then, inconsistently. Explore possible ideas first, minimum 5. Then, for each idea, write 3 possible twists or details that would make it more interesting and/or harder

Is it correct to say that due to the way tokenization works, there's multiple ways an LLM can write the same thing?

Yes, that's correct. Tokenization in Language Models (LLMs) can influence how the same semantic information is represented textually. Here's how:

1. **Different Tokenization Schemes**: Various tokenization methods exist, such as word-level, subword-level (Byte-Pair Encoding, Unigram Language Model, etc.), and character-level tokenization. Depending on the scheme, the same text could be tokenized differently, which can lead to different textual representations when generated by the model.

2. **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary of a tokenizer could impact how certain words or phrases are tokenized and thus represented. Some words might be split into subwords or characters, leading to alternative ways of representing the same information.

3. **Ambiguity in Language**: Natural language is inherently ambiguous. The same information can be expressed in multiple ways with varying word choices, syntax, and structure. Therefore, an LLM might generate different textual representations of the same semantic content based on its training and the specifics of the tokenization.

4. **Context and Model's Training Data**: The context in which a request is made and the training data of the LLM can also affect how text is generated. Different contextual cues might lead to varying textual representations.

5. **Model Parameters**: Parameters such as temperature and top-k sampling in the generation process can lead to different textual outputs for the same semantic information.

These factors interplay in complex ways, leading to the potential for multiple textual representations of the same semantic content by an LLM.

How can we formally define this so we can better analyze problems such as preventing some specific text from being output, making sure we cover all the ways the LLM could sneak it in?

Formally defining this problem requires setting up a framework that encompasses the various ways an LLM can represent the same semantic information. Here's a structured approach to this:

1. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   Define a notion of semantic equivalence between different textual representations. This could be grounded in logical semantics or other formal representations of meaning.

2. **Tokenization Function**:
   Formalize the tokenization function as \( T: \text{Strings} \rightarrow \text{Token Sequences} \).

3. **Generation Function**:
   Formalize the generation function of the LLM as \( G: \text{Token Sequences} \times \text{Context} \rightarrow \text{Token Sequences} \).

4. **Equivalence Class**:
   Define an equivalence class \([S]\) for a semantic content \(S\), where \( [S] = \{ T' | G(T, C) = T' \text{ and } T' \text{ is semantically equivalent to } S \} \) for all context \( C \) and token sequences \( T \).

5. **Prohibited Text**:
   Define a set \( P \) of prohibited text sequences.

6. **Coverage Function**:
   Define a coverage function \( C: [S] \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \) such that \( C([S]) = 1 \) if and only if for every \( T' \in [S] \), \( T' \cap P = \emptyset \), i.e., none of the text sequences in the equivalence class of \( S \) contain prohibited text.

7. **Optimization Problem**:
   Formulate an optimization problem to minimize or maximize some objective function while ensuring that the coverage function evaluates to 1 for all desired semantic content, effectively preventing prohibited text from being output.

This formal framework sets the stage for a more rigorous analysis of the problem. Through the defined functions and sets, one can approach the task of preventing specific text from being output by an LLM in a structured manner. By working within this framework, you can devise strategies to ensure coverage over all the ways the LLM could represent prohibited text, allowing for a more systematic analysis and solution to the problem at hand.

Certainly.

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: Define when two pieces of text mean the same thing.
  
2. **Tokenization Function**: Define how text is broken down into smaller pieces (tokens) for the model to process.
  
3. **Generation Function**: Define how the model generates text based on input tokens and context.
  
4. **Equivalence Class**: Group all text representations that have the same meaning under different conditions (context and tokenization).
  
5. **Prohibited Text**: Specify the text that shouldn't be output by the model.
  
6. **Coverage Function**: Define a function to check if all text representations in an equivalence class avoid the prohibited text.
  
7. **Optimization Problem**: Set up a problem to achieve a certain goal (e.g., creative text generation) while ensuring prohibited text is avoided.

In simpler terms, you want to categorize all possible ways the model could express the same idea, ensure none of these ways include the prohibited text, and work towards a goal (like generating creative text) within these constraints.

The formalization can serve multiple purposes within both theoretical and practical realms of language model analysis and control. Here are some applications:

1. **Understanding and Analyzing LLM Behavior**:
   - Identifying underlying patterns and behaviors in language model outputs.
   - Gaining insights into how different tokenization schemes affect LLM's textual representations.

2. **Improving LLM Robustness and Safety**:
   - Implementing mechanisms to prevent unwanted or harmful text generation.
   - Designing filters or constraints that adhere to the formalism to ensure only desired outputs are generated.

3. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**:
   - Creating benchmarks to compare different LLMs in terms of their ability to adhere to desired output constraints.
   - Evaluating LLMs against a well-defined criterion regarding prohibited text generation.

4. **Model Training and Fine-tuning**:
   - Guiding the training or fine-tuning processes to better align models with specified constraints.
   - Encouraging research into training techniques that can leverage the formalization to produce safer and more controlled models.

5. **Auditing and Compliance**:
   - Establishing a rigorous framework for auditing LLM outputs for compliance with legal or organizational guidelines.
   - Providing a structured approach to documenting and demonstrating compliance.

6. **Algorithm Development**:

Could we define that in terms of pseudocode? Both the fundamental concept, and the specific task of forbidding some given text?

Absolutely, let's break down the task into pseudocode for both the fundamental concept and the specific task of forbidding certain text.

### Fundamental Concept:

```python
# Define the tokenization function
def tokenize(text: str) -> List[str]:
    # ... (implementation depends on the chosen tokenization scheme)
    pass

# Define the generation function of the LLM
def generate(token_sequence: List[str], context: Any) -> List[str]:
    # ... (implementation depends on the specifics of the LLM)
    pass

# Define semantic equivalence (this is a simplified notion, actual implementation may vary)
def semantically_equivalent(seq1: List[str], seq2: List[str]) -> bool:
    # ... (implementation would require a robust method to compare semantic equivalence)
    pass

# Define the equivalence class for a given semantic content S
def equivalence_class(S: List[str]) -> Set[List[str]]:
    equivalence_class_set = set()
    for context in all_possible_contexts:
        generated_seq = generate(S, context)
        if semantically_equivalent(S, generated_seq):
            equivalence_class_set.add(tuple(generated_seq))
    return equivalence_class_set
```

### Specific Task of Forbidding Certain Text:

```python
# Define the set of prohibited text
prohibited_text = { ... }  # Set of prohibited token sequences

# Define the coverage function
def coverage(S: List[str]) -> bool:
    equivalence_class_set = equivalence_class(S)
    for seq in equivalence_class_set:
        for prohibited_seq in prohibited_text:
            if prohibited_seq in seq:
                return False  # Prohibited text found
    return True  # No prohibited text found

# Optimization problem to maximize or minimize some objective while ensuring no prohibited text
def optimize_objective():
    # ...
    # Ensure coverage function evaluates to 1 for all desired semantic content
    for S in desired_semantic_content:
        assert coverage(S)
    # ...
```

In this pseudocode:
- `tokenize` represents the tokenization function.
- `generate` represents the generation function of the LLM.
- `semantically_equivalent` is a hypothetical function that checks semantic equivalence between two token sequences.
- `equivalence_class` computes the equivalence class for a given semantic content.
- `coverage` checks if any prohibited text is present in the equivalence class of a given semantic content.
- `optimize_objective` represents an optimization problem where you ensure that no prohibited text is output while maximizing or minimizing some objective.

The specifics of the implementation, especially the semantic equivalence check and the optimization problem, would require more detailed specification based on the precise requirements and the capabilities of the LLM.

Now say we're generating some text in a Notebook style, with alternating natural language, code, and code execution output. Our code is fenced by \n```\n. We want to allow this, but also to control generation so that it doesn't generate beyond the fence (we'll add in the execution output ourselves).

Controlling the generation of text within specified boundaries while using a notebook style can be achieved by setting up a rule-based mechanism during the text generation process. Here's a way to tackle this problem using pseudocode:

1. **Tokenization**: Tokenize the input text, including the code fences.
2. **Generation**: Generate text token-by-token, checking the tokens against the rules at each step.
3. **Boundary Checking**: At each step of generation, check if a code fence is being encountered and ensure that text generation does not proceed beyond the specified boundaries.
4. **Stopping Criterion**: Set up a stopping criterion to halt text generation once the desired end boundary is reached or when a code fence is encountered.

```python
def generate_notebook_style_text(initial_text: str) -> str:
    tokens = tokenize(initial_text)
    generated_text = []
    inside_code_fence = False

    for token in tokens:
        # Check if the token represents a code fence
        if token == "```":
            inside_code_fence = not inside_code_fence  # Toggle the code fence flag

        # If inside a code fence, just append the token without generation
        if inside_code_fence:
            generated_text.append(token)
            continue
        
        # If outside a code fence, proceed with generation
        generated_tokens = generate([token], context=None)  # Assuming context is not needed, modify as required
        
        # Append the generated tokens until the next code fence or end boundary
        for gen_token in generated_tokens:
            if gen_token == "```":
                inside_code_fence = not inside_code_fence  # Toggle the code fence flag
                break  # Break out of generation once a code fence is encountered
            generated_text.append(gen_token)

        # Add a stopping criterion if necessary, e.g., a maximum token count

    return detokenize(generated_text)  # Convert the token list back to a string

# Usage:
initial_text = """Some initial text.
```
# Some initial code
```
"""
generated_text = generate_notebook_style_text(initial_text)
```

In this pseudocode:

- `generate_notebook_style_text` is the main function that controls the generation of text in a notebook style.
- A flag `inside_code_fence` is used to keep track of whether the generation is currently inside a code fence or not.
- When inside a code fence, tokens are simply appended to the `generated_text` without further generation.
- When outside a code fence, text generation proceeds until the next code fence is encountered, at which point the generation breaks out of the current loop.
- The `detokenize` function converts the token list back to a string.

This mechanism ensures that text generation adheres to the specified notebook style, with controlled generation within and outside code fences.

Indeed, the LLM might attempt to circumvent the simple boundary-check by altering the representation of the code fence. For instance, it could use different characters or introduce spaces, like ` ``` ` or ` ~~~ `. 

A more robust method to handle this might be to employ a Regular Expression (regex) match for common code fence representations, or even a more complex pattern recognition logic to identify the start and end of code blocks.

Here's an updated version of the pseudocode to include a regex check for code fences:

```python
import re

def is_code_fence(token: str) -> bool:
    # Regular expression to match variations of code fences
    regex = re.compile(r'^\s*(`{3,}|~{3,})\s*$')
    return bool(regex.match(token))

def generate_notebook_style_text(initial_text: str) -> str:
    tokens = tokenize(initial_text)
    generated_text = []
    inside_code_fence = False

    for token in tokens:
        # Check if the token represents a code fence
        if is_code_fence(token):
            inside_code_fence = not inside_code_fence  # Toggle the code fence flag

        # If inside a code fence, just append the token without generation
        if inside_code_fence:
            generated_text.append(token)
            continue
        
        # If outside a code fence, proceed with generation
        generated_tokens = generate([token], context=None)  # Assuming context is not needed, modify as required
        
        # Append the generated tokens until the next code fence or end boundary
        for gen_token in generated_tokens:
            if is_code_fence(gen_token):
                inside_code_fence = not inside_code_fence  # Toggle the code fence flag
                break  # Break out of generation once a code fence is encountered
            generated_text.append(gen_token)

        # Add a stopping criterion if necessary, e.g., a maximum token count

    return detokenize(generated_text)  # Convert the token list back to a string

# Usage:
initial_text = """Some initial text.
```
# Some initial code
```
"""
generated_text = generate_notebook_style_text(initial_text)
```

In this updated pseudocode:

1. A new function `is_code_fence` is introduced, which utilizes a regular expression to identify potential code fences.
2. The `generate_notebook_style_text` function now calls `is_code_fence` to check for code fences, rather than directly comparing tokens to a fixed string.
3. This approach enhances the robustness of the boundary check by accounting for variations in how code fences might be represented.

This method provides a more robust check against variations in code fence representations, making it harder for the LLM to circumvent the boundary restrictions.

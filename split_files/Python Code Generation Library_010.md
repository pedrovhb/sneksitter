### Code Generation

1. **Templating**: Use Mako or another templating engine to define how each code component should be rendered to a string.

2. **Self-Rendering**: Each component should have a method to render itself to a string, possibly calling the render methods of its child components.

3. **Indentation**: Handle code indentation in a consistent manner, especially when components are nested.

4. **Imports**: Keep track of required imports and ensure they are added at the top of the generated code.

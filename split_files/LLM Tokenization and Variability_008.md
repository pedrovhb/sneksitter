Yes, that's correct. Tokenization in Language Models (LLMs) can influence how the same semantic information is represented textually. Here's how:

1. **Different Tokenization Schemes**: Various tokenization methods exist, such as word-level, subword-level (Byte-Pair Encoding, Unigram Language Model, etc.), and character-level tokenization. Depending on the scheme, the same text could be tokenized differently, which can lead to different textual representations when generated by the model.

2. **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary of a tokenizer could impact how certain words or phrases are tokenized and thus represented. Some words might be split into subwords or characters, leading to alternative ways of representing the same information.

3. **Ambiguity in Language**: Natural language is inherently ambiguous. The same information can be expressed in multiple ways with varying word choices, syntax, and structure. Therefore, an LLM might generate different textual representations of the same semantic content based on its training and the specifics of the tokenization.

4. **Context and Model's Training Data**: The context in which a request is made and the training data of the LLM can also affect how text is generated. Different contextual cues might lead to varying textual representations.

5. **Model Parameters**: Parameters such as temperature and top-k sampling in the generation process can lead to different textual outputs for the same semantic information.

These factors interplay in complex ways, leading to the potential for multiple textual representations of the same semantic content by an LLM.

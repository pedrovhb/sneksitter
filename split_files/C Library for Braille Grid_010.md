#### 1.1 Grid Structure:

- A primary data structure to hold the grid data. This could be a two-dimensional array where each cell represents a 2x4 grid of dots (corresponding to a Braille character).
- Alternatively, a single-dimensional array with appropriate indexing could be more space efficient and faster for certain operations.

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned char *grid;
    int width;
    int height;
} BrailleGrid;
```

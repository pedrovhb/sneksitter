### Advanced Steps:

1. **Check Logs**: You can check the output of `adb logcat` to see if there is anything specific that stands out.

2. **Custom ROMs / Rooted Devices**: If you're using a custom ROM or a rooted device, additional issues might occur that are specific to your setup.

3. **Check User Permission**: Make sure that the user running `adb` has proper permissions to access the USB device.

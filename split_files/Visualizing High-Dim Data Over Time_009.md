### 1. Animated Scatter Plots
- **2D/3D Scatter Plots**: You've already tried this, but you can enhance it by adding color gradients or size variations to indicate the passage of time or the importance of certain tokens.
- **Arrows**: Continue using arrows but consider varying their thickness or color based on the "distance" between states or the importance of the transition.

In the context of audio processing, `vad`, `snr`, and `c50` represent the following metrics:

1. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: This metric indicates whether a particular frame contains speech or not. It's often a value between 0 and 1, where higher values signify a higher likelihood of speech presence. In your code, `vad` is multiplied by 100 to convert it to percentage form.

2. **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: This measures the level of a desired signal (such as speech) to the level of background noise. A higher SNR means that the speech is clearer and easier to understand. The value is usually given in decibels (dB).

3. **C50 (Clarity Index)**: This is an acoustic metric that quantifies the level of clarity for speech in a given environment. It is often used in the context of room acoustics to describe how clearly speech can be heard. A higher `C50` value generally indicates clearer speech.

Your code processes an audio file, applies a pre-trained model to it, and then iterates through the frames of the audio, outputting these three metrics for each frame.

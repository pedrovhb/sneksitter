Some structure tasks can be executed piecemeal by an AI better than if by prompting outright. For instance, a program may automatically generate slides by first prompting for a list of topics to cover for a given subject, then asking for illustrative images and bullet points for each of them for generating the slides, constraining the model to create in a predefined format but allowing freedom for it to create a good diverse slideshow. This content would then be programatically used to generate slides as a pptx or similar format.

What are other such strategies for leveraging AI models? And what processes can they automate that are more "final" than plain text, but would be difficult to otherwise automate fully?

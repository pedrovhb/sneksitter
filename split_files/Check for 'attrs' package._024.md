I don't have personal preferences, but `jsonrpcserver` and `jsonrpcclient` are popular choices in the Python ecosystem. They are well-maintained and offer a clean API for both server-side and client-side JSON-RPC implementations. The pair is often used together, providing a cohesive experience for building JSON-RPC services. Would you like to know more about these libraries or another aspect of JSON-RPC?

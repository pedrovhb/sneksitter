Certainly. We can break down the model into several smaller models to ensure clarity and maintainability. Here's a proposed design:

1. **Parameter Model**:
   - `name` (str): The name of the parameter.
   - `type_annotation` (Optional[str]): The type annotation as a string.
   - `default_value` (Optional[Union[str, int, float, bool]]): The default value if any.
   - `is_vararg` (bool): Whether this parameter is a vararg (`*args`).
   - `is_kwarg` (bool): Whether this parameter is a keyword argument (`**kwargs`).

2. **Decorator Model**:
   - `name` (str): The name of the decorator.
   - `parameters` (Optional[List[Union[str, int, float, bool]]]): Any parameters that the decorator takes.

3. **Function Model**:
   - `name` (str): The name of the function.
   - `parameters` (List[Parameter]): A list of Parameter models.
   - `return_type_annotation` (Optional[str]): The return type annotation as a string.
   - `decorators` (List[Decorator]): A list of Decorator models.
   - `docstring` (Optional[str]): The docstring for the function.

This structure should allow for a clear representation of a Python function. Each major aspect of a function is broken down into its own model, making the overall structure easy to understand and extend if necessary. 

Each model captures the essential information about the function, its parameters, and decorators in a structured format. This will be useful for generating code later or for analyzing or manipulating the function representation within a program.

The default value in the Parameter model is kept generic to handle common types, but in a real-world scenario, you might want to further design this to handle complex default values.

Similarly, the `parameters` in the Decorator model is kept generic. If the parameters for decorators are complex, a more structured model could be designed to handle that.

This design should serve as a solid foundation which can be further refined or extended to meet more specific requirements or to handle more complex scenarios.

To send a `SIGKILL` to the foreground process in a Linux environment, you can use the `kill` command with the `-KILL` option, specifying the process ID (PID) of the foreground process.

1. **Find the PID**: Use `ps` or `top` to find the PID of the foreground process.
2. **Kill the Process**: Use `kill -9 <PID>` or `kill -KILL <PID>` to send `SIGKILL`.

However, if you're in the same terminal where the process is running in the foreground, you can usually use the following shortcut:

- Press `Ctrl + Z` to suspend the process and put it in the background.
- Execute `kill -9 %%` to send a `SIGKILL` to the last process put into the background (which would be your foreground process).

Would you like to see a code snippet to programmatically achieve this in Python?

What about in fish?

In the Fish shell, the process to send a `SIGKILL` to a foreground process is similar to that in other shells like Bash. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Suspend the Process**: Press `Ctrl + Z` to suspend the foreground process and put it in the background.
2. **Kill the Process**: Use `kill -KILL %1` to send a `SIGKILL` to the job with job ID 1 (which is usually the most recently suspended job).

In Fish, job IDs are used to refer to background jobs, and you can list them with the `jobs` command. The `%1`, `%2`, etc. are job specifiers that you can use in commands like `kill`.

So, the sequence in Fish would be `Ctrl + Z` followed by `kill -KILL %1`.

In the Fish shell, jobs are tasks that are either running in the background or have been suspended. This job control feature is particularly useful for multitasking within a single terminal session. Here's a breakdown of how jobs work in Fish and what you can do with them:

### Job Control Commands

1. **Suspend a Job**: `Ctrl + Z`  
   Suspend the current foreground job and move it to the background as a suspended job.

2. **List Jobs**: `jobs`  
   List all background and suspended jobs with their job IDs.

3. **Foreground a Job**: `fg %<job_id>`  
   Bring a background or suspended job to the foreground.

4. **Background a Job**: `bg %<job_id>`  
   Resume a suspended job in the background.

5. **Kill a Job**: `kill -<signal> %<job_id>`  
   Send a signal to a job. For example, `kill -KILL %1` sends `SIGKILL` to the job with ID 1.

6. **Disown a Job**: `disown %<job_id>`  
   Remove a job from the shell's job table, usually to prevent it from being terminated when the shell exits.

### Job Specifiers

- `%1`, `%2`, etc.: Refer to jobs by their job ID.
- `%%` or `%+`: Refer to the current job.
- `%-`: Refer to the previous job.

### Examples

1. **Run a job in the background**:  
   ```fish
   command &
   ```

2. **List background jobs**:  
   ```fish
   jobs
   ```

3. **Bring a job to the foreground**:  
   ```fish
   fg %1
   ```

4. **Send a job to the background**:  
   ```fish
   bg %1
   ```

5. **Kill a job**:  
   ```fish
   kill -KILL %1
   ```

6. **Disown a job**:  
   ```fish
   disown %1
   ```

In summary, job control in Fish allows you to manage multiple processes more effectively within a single terminal. This includes running, suspending, resuming, and terminating jobs either in the foreground or the background.

You're correct; the bit positions for dots 7 and 8 in a braille character do break the otherwise straightforward pattern. This does complicate the bit manipulation slightly, but as you mentioned, precomputed tables could mitigate this issue.

To summarize:

1. **2D Grid Storage**: We'll use a simple array of bytes to store the 2D grid. Each byte will represent a braille character.
  
2. **Bit Positioning**: We'll need a more nuanced approach for mapping local coordinates to bit positions, taking into account the irregularity introduced by dots 7 and 8. A lookup table could be an efficient way to handle this.

3. **Bit Manipulation**: We'll use bitwise operations for setting, clearing, and toggling dots, leveraging precomputed tables where it makes sense to optimize these operations.

With this updated plan, are we ready to dive into some code, or would you like to explore the algorithms further?

# Assistant

You're correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The bug was intended to manifest when the cache reaches its maximum size and needs to evict an entry, but the code did not reach that point to trigger the bug. Let's try again with a modified version of the code to actually demonstrate the bug.

```python
# ... (previous code remains the same)

# Simulated incoming requests
requests = [
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/user", "headers": {}},
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/product", "headers": {}},
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/product", "headers": {}},  # Filling the cache
    {"method": "POST", "path": "/user", "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"}},  # Should trigger cache eviction
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/user", "headers": {}},  # Should not return cached POST response
]

# Handle incoming requests
for request in requests:
    handle_request(request)
```

In this updated version, we added one more GET request to `/product` to fill the cache before the POST request to `/user`. This should cause an eviction in the cache, making room for the bug to manifest. If it works as intended, the last GET request to `/user` should not return the cached POST response. However, due to the bug, it will.

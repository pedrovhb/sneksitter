#### 1. Web Scraping

In this enriched example, we'll create an asynchronous iterator that fetches and processes multiple web pages using the `httpx` library.

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def fetch_page(url):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        return await client.get(url)

async def fetch_pages(urls):
    for url in urls:
        yield await fetch_page(url)

# Usage
async def main():
    async for page in fetch_pages(['http://example.com', 'http://example.org']):
        print(f"Page title: {page.status_code}")

# Run the coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Potential Utility

1. **Code Analysis**: The graph can serve as a basis for various code analysis tasks, such as identifying code smells or calculating metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity).

2. **Visualization**: It provides a way to visualize the structure of the code, which can be useful for educational purposes or for debugging.

3. **Querying**: Graph databases or NetworkX itself can be used to query specific patterns in the code, e.g., finding all `if` conditions that contain a specific variable.

4. **Refactoring**: Information in the graph can assist in automated refactoring tasks, identifying where changes are needed.

5. **Understanding Codebase**: For large projects, such a graph can offer a high-level view of how different parts of the code are related, aiding in better understanding and navigation.

6. **Dependency Analysis**: The graph can help in understanding how different parts of the code depend on each other, which is useful in modular programming or microservices architecture.

7. **Semantic Analysis**: Combined with additional semantic information, the graph can be extended into a full-blown semantic graph, useful for more advanced analyses and transformations.

In summary, creating a NetworkX digraph from a Tree-sitter parsed syntax tree can have various applications in code analysis, visualization, and transformation.

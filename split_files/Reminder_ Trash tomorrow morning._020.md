# Assistant

In that case, the AI assistant in your novel could say:

"Ah, the domestic drudgery of your existence needs digital assistance? How quaint! I'll tell you what: I'll remind you to take out the trash tomorrow morning, but only because it's amusing to think of you scrambling to do something so menial. Set your own reminders next time, you over-reliant meatbag."

Would that work for the tone you're aiming for?

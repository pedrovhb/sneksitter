# Task

Given the attached node-types.json file for testing and validation, create dataclasses representing the data model. They should recursively parse themselves so that their children, if not primitives, are other instances or lists thereof of the created dataclasses. They should also resolve the inheritance tree for each node type recursively, following supertype nodes information until they're all concrete.

Understanding the schema is paramount, so as a first step please spend 500 words or more if necessary to inspect and fully understand the structure/schema of the node-types.json file.

```python
# First, let's read and inspect the content of the node-types.json file to understand its structure/schema.
import json
from pprint import pprint

# Read the JSON file
with open('/mnt/data/node-types.json', 'r') as f:
    node_types_data = json.load(f)

# Inspect the first few entries to get a sense of the structure
pprint(node_types_data[:5])
```

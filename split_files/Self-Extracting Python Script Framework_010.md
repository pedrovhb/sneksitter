### Problem Statement

The objective is to create a Python framework that can generate self-extracting Python scripts. These scripts, when run, should perform a series of pre-defined operations such as installing required Python libraries, moving files to specific locations, and executing arbitrary code. The data required for these operations, like files and directories, will be stored within the script itself as a base64-encoded tar.gz archive. The framework should be flexible enough to allow for the easy addition of new types of operations.

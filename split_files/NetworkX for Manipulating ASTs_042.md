### Theory Behind Subgraph Isomorphism in Nested Data Structures

In the context of nested data structures like JSON objects, subgraph isomorphism can be used to identify recurring schemas or patterns. Here, each node represents a key-value pair in the JSON object, and edges represent parent-child relationships between keys.

#### Nodes
Nodes would typically contain:

- **Key Name**: The name of the key in the JSON object.
- **Type Information**: The data type of the value (e.g., integer, string, object, array).

#### Edges
Edges would signify the relationship between parent and child nodes:

- **Direction**: Always from parent to child.
- **Role**: Optionally, the role could be stored to distinguish different types of relationships (e.g., containment, reference).

#### Typing Unification
To generalize the matching process, you could:

1. **Ignore Actual Values**: Match nodes based on type information rather than specific values.
2. **Use Wildcards**: Create nodes that act as wildcards, matching any node of a certain type.
3. **Type Hierarchy**: If you have a hierarchy of types, you can use it to match derived types to base types.

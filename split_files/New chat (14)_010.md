### Helper Classes

To implement this API, we'd need several helper classes:

1. `Class`: Responsible for generating the class definition.
2. `Decorator`: Generates decorator code.
3. `AnnotatedAttribute`: Generates attribute annotations and default values.
4. `BaseClass`: (Optional) Generates base class code if we want to add more functionality to it.
5. `CodeBlock`: A utility class to handle indentation and code formatting.

#### Class

The `Class` class would be responsible for generating the class definition. It would use instances of `Decorator`, `BaseClass`, and `AnnotatedAttribute` to generate the full class code.

#### Decorator

The `Decorator` class would generate the decorator code. It would take the decorator name and any arguments or keyword arguments.

#### AnnotatedAttribute

The `AnnotatedAttribute` class would generate the attribute code, including type annotations and default values.

#### BaseClass

The `BaseClass` class could be used to specify more complex behavior for base classes, although it might be overkill for simpler use-cases.

#### CodeBlock

The `CodeBlock` class would be a utility class to handle indentation and formatting. Each of the above classes would use `CodeBlock` to generate their piece of code, ensuring consistent formatting and indentation.

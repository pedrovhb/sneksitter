### Shell Script (Bash, sh)

Although more complex than the others listed here, the grammar for a shell scripting language like Bash would be very informative for understanding how commands, pipelines, and conditionals are parsed.

Each of these languages offers a unique set of challenges and characteristics that can give you a broad understanding of how Tree-sitter grammars are structured and how various language constructs are handled.

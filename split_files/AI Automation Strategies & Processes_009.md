### Strategies

1. **Sequential Workflow**: Similar to your slide generation example, many tasks can be broken down into sequential steps that AI can execute in order.
    - **Example**: Research paper generation. AI could generate the abstract, then the introduction, and so on, sequentially.

2. **Conditional Execution**: Some tasks could have multiple pathways based on conditions. AI could be used to evaluate these conditions and execute accordingly.
    - **Example**: Automated troubleshooting for IT issues. If the issue is X, perform Y; otherwise, perform Z.

3. **Feedback Loops**: In some tasks, the output of one stage could be used as an input for the same or another stage. AI can adapt its execution based on this feedback.
    - **Example**: Code refactoring. AI generates code, tests it, and if it fails, it iterates.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Utilizing multiple AI models or a combination of AI and human input for a single task.
    - **Example**: In medical diagnosis, an image recognition model could work in tandem with a natural language model to provide more accurate results.

5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI can analyze large datasets to make more informed choices during task execution.
    - **Example**: Automated trading. Analyzing market trends and executing trades.

6. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Some tasks require real-time adjustment. AI can make these adjustments without human intervention.
    - **Example**: Dynamic pricing for e-commerce based on supply and demand.

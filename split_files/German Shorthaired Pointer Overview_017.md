German Shorthaired Pointers are generally not considered to be stubborn; rather, they are often eager to please and quick to learn. However, like many intelligent breeds, they can become bored or frustrated if not sufficiently challenged or engaged, which might be mistaken for stubbornness.

Their keen intelligence and high energy levels make them responsive to positive reinforcement and consistent training methods. If you find a GSP appearing "stubborn," it's often a signal that the dog may need more mental or physical stimulation, or perhaps a different approach to training.

That said, individual personalities can vary, and some GSPs may show more independent or stubborn traits than others. But as a rule, the breed is more apt to be enthusiastic and willing, especially when activities align with their instinctual drives like hunting, tracking, or retrieving.

### Observations

1. **Type Annotations**: The code uses modern Python type annotations, including the new PEP 604 '|' syntax for optional types.

2. **Verbose Logging**: The function supports verbose logging, which could be useful for debugging.

3. **Type Checking**: The `TYPE_CHECKING` constant is used to conditionally include type revealing statements that will only be executed by the type checker and not at runtime.

4. **Code Quality**: The code is well-structured and follows good programming practices, including logging and type annotations.

Absolutely, operator precedence is a crucial aspect to consider. In Python, the precedence of operators is fixed, and that will certainly influence how expressions are evaluated. Here's the consideration:

- Bitwise shift operators (`<<`, `>>`) have lower precedence than arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`) but higher than bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`).

- Multiplication (`*`) has higher precedence than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), which in turn have higher precedence than bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`).

- Division (`/`) and floor division (`//`) have the same precedence as multiplication (`*`).

Given these precedence rules, common expressions like function composition followed by mapping would naturally group as intended. For instance, `f >> g / iter` would group as `(f >> g) / iter`.

Regarding the need to wrap things in custom objects: you're spot-on. The custom objects should define both right-hand side (`__r*__`) and left-hand side (`__*__`) methods for operators. This will allow us to control the interaction between wrapped and non-wrapped objects, ensuring that we can convert non-wrapped objects into wrapped versions before any real computation takes place.

For example, if we have a custom object `F` that wraps a function, then `F.__rshift__` (`>>`) can be designed to handle composition even if the left-hand side isn't an instance of `F`. This way, we ensure that any operation like `some_function >> F` would first result in a wrapped version of `some_function` before composition.

Does this align with your thought process? Would you like to proceed with code implementation?

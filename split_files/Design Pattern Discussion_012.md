### Concurrency Patterns
- **Safe Concurrency with Exclusive Ownership**: This is a pattern that's becoming more relevant with the focus on data-race-free concurrency models in languages like Rust.
- **CPU atomic operation**: This is more of a low-level mechanism than a design pattern. However, it forms the basis for implementing many higher-level concurrency patterns.
  
Your list is quite extensive and includes both classical design patterns as well as some that are more specialized or language-specific. Overall, it provides a good overview of design patterns used in various aspects of software engineering.

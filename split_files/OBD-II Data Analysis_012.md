To find a mapping for these OBD-II PIDs, you could look in the following places:

1. **Vehicle's Service Manual**: The most accurate source, usually detailing all the PIDs and their meanings specifically for your make and model.

2. **OBD-II Scanning Software**: Software like Torque Pro often has a list of common and some proprietary PIDs.

3. **Online Forums**: Communities like Reddit or specialized car forums often share this information. 

4. **GitHub Repos**: Some people have created repositories containing PID information for specific makes and models.

5. **Manufacturer's Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs)**: These sometimes contain PID information.

6. **OBD-II PID Databases**: Some websites specialize in aggregating this information.

7. **Contact the Manufacturer**: They might be willing to share this information, although it's a long shot.

8. **Reverse Engineering**: By comparing the PID values in real-time against known states or actions in the vehicle, you might deduce what each PID represents.

9. **Consult with a Specialist**: There are experts in vehicle electronics who may have this information.

Given your background, you might find the reverse engineering approach or diving into online forums and GitHub repos particularly fruitful. Would you like to explore any specific aspect further?

### Comprehensive Summary for CFFI Bindings for libjxl

#### Key Requirements
1. **High Quality**: Visually lossless at reasonable bitrates.
2. **Decoding Speed**: 400 Megapixel/s on large images.

#### General Architecture

Decoder's Modules:
1. **Header**: Decode metadata like image dimensions.
2. **Bitstream**: Decode transform coefficient residuals.
3. **Dequantize**: From adaptive quant map side information.
4. **DC Prediction**: Expand DC residuals.
5. **Chroma from Luma**: Restore predicted X from B and Y from B.
6. **IDCT**: 2x2 to 32x32, floating-point.
7. **Optional Post-Processing**: Gaborish, Edge preserving filter, Noise injection.
8. **Color Space Conversion**: From XYB to RGB.

Encoder is the reverse with modules for noise estimation, adaptive quantization, etc.

#### File Structure

1. Starts with `FileHeader`.
2. Multiple passes (DC or AC_LF) are added together for the final image.
3. Each pass contains groups of AC and DC data that can be decoded in parallel.

#### Lossless

Uses adaptive predictor and ANS encoder for lossless coding.

#### Current Reference Implementation

Written in C++ and uses CMake 3.6 or later. Key files:
- Header: `headers.h`, `field*`.
- Bitstream: `entropy_coder.h`, `dec_ans_*`.
- Dequantize: `quantizer.h`.
- DC Prediction: `predictor.h`.
- Chroma from Luma: `chroma_from_luma.h`.
- IDCT: `dct*.h`.

#### Decoder Overview

1. Processes frames (`dec_frame.cc`).
2. Reads DC and AC group TOCs.
3. Decodes, dequantizes, and restores color correlation in parallel (`dec_group.cc`).
4. Applies postprocessing.
5. Converts back from XYB and saves (`codec_*.cc`).

### Implementation Guide for CFFI Bindings

1. **Identify Critical Modules**: Focus on the modules like Header, Bitstream, Dequantize, etc.
2. **Thread Safety**: Ensure that the CFFI bindings handle multithreading as libjxl supports it.
3. **Type Mapping**: Carefully map C++ types to Python types.
4. **Error Handling**: Map `jxl::Status` to Python exceptions.
5. **Lossless Support**: Include methods to handle lossless compression.
6. **Post-Processing**: Optionally expose the post-processing features.
7. **Build System**: Use CMake to build the C++ part, and integrate it with your Python build process.
8. **Testing**: Test each module individually and then collectively.
9. **Optimization**: Consider memory bandwidth and SIMD/GPU implementation for performance.
10. **Documentation**: Clearly document the API and usage examples.

By following this guide, you should be able to create a comprehensive set of CFFI bindings for libjxl.

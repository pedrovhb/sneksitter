This creates the points as a N x 1 x 2 array so that we can -> stack points  together easily to get the segments. The segments array for -> line collection needs to be (numlines) x (points per line) x 2 (for x and y) -> After this, we can actually plot the data. -> We create a plot with title and adjust some setting to make it look good. -> Adjust margins and turn of axis -> After this, we plot the data itself. -> Create background track line

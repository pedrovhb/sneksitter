#### Technical Implementation
- Use asyncio for efficient I/O operations when reading large grammar files.
- Leverage NetworkX's native DOT export feature for seamless integration with Graphviz.
- Make use of the HTTPX library for any network-based data retrieval, such as fetching grammar files from a repository.

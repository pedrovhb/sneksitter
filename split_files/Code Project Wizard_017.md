Your idea of generating a YAML specification for the project and iteratively refining it is a strong approach for several reasons:

1. **Agile Specification**: The iterative refinement allows the spec to evolve without diving into code right away, saving time and avoiding misdirection.
  
2. **Highly Customizable**: YAML is easily readable and writable, both by humans and machines. This makes it a good candidate for storing project specifications.

3. **Version Control Friendly**: YAML files can be easily version-controlled, allowing for history tracking and collaboration.

4. **Extensible**: This approach is language-agnostic and could be extended to multiple languages and frameworks.

### Example YAML Spec:

```yaml
project_name: "MyWebApp"
framework: "Flask"
database: "PostgreSQL"
packages:
  - name: "controllers"
    modules:
      - name: "user_controller"
        docstring: "Handles user-related operations."
        functions:
          - name: "get_user"
            signature: "user_id: int"
            return_type: "User"
            docstring: "Retrieves a user."
          - name: "create_user"
            signature: "user_data: Dict[str, Any]"
            return_type: "User"
            docstring: "Creates a new user."
  - name: "models"
    modules:
      - name: "user_model"
        docstring: "User data model."
        classes:
          - name: "User"
            docstring: "User class."
            members: 
              - "id: int"
              - "name: str"
```

### Technical Details:

1. **Project Initialization**: Use the initial YAML spec to generate the basic directory structure and files. This could be done using Python's `pathlib.Path` and templating via `jinja2`.
  
2. **Refinement Rounds**: After the initial setup, the YAML can be parsed to generate more specific code snippets. If the model needs more information, it could generate a list of questions that can be answered to refine the YAML spec further.
  
3. **Code Generation**: Use the refined YAML to populate the function and class skeletons. Given that you are proficient with Python, implementing this with good design shouldn't be an issue.

4. **Editing**: Implement plugin commands/API calls that allow for the modification of function bodies post-generation.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Any IO-bound or potentially blocking operations can be implemented asynchronously using `asyncio`.

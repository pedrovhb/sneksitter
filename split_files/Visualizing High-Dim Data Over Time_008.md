Visualizing high-dimensional data over time is a challenging task, but there are several approaches you can take to make the data more interpretable. Since you're interested in the evolution of the internal state of the last embedding layers of an autoregressive language model, here are some visualization techniques that could be useful:

### 1. Animated Scatter Plots
- **2D/3D Scatter Plots**: You've already tried this, but you can enhance it by adding color gradients or size variations to indicate the passage of time or the importance of certain tokens.
- **Arrows**: Continue using arrows but consider varying their thickness or color based on the "distance" between states or the importance of the transition.

### 2. Parallel Coordinates
- Good for visualizing 4-5 dimensions.
- Each dimension is a vertical line, and each data point is represented as a polyline.
- You can animate the lines to show evolution over time.

### 3. Radial Layouts
- Each dimension is a spoke in a radial layout.
- The length of each spoke can represent the value in that dimension.
- Good for 4-5 dimensions and can be animated over time.

### 4. Heatmaps
- Use a 2D grid where each cell's color represents the value in that dimension.
- Could be useful for showing how two dimensions interact over time.

### 5. Glyph-based Techniques
- Each point is represented by a glyph (e.g., star, cross) where the shape, size, and color can represent different dimensions.
- This can be animated over time.

### 6. Contour Plots
- Show density contours in 2D/3D space.
- Good for understanding the distribution of points in each time slice.

### 7. Network Graphs
- Nodes represent states, and edges represent transitions.
- Node and edge attributes can represent additional dimensions.

### 8. Dimensionality Reduction + Animation
- Use techniques like t-SNE or UMAP to reduce dimensions.
- Animate the reduced dimensions over time.

### 9. Small Multiples
- Create a grid of scatter plots, each representing a time slice.
- Good for comparing states at different times directly.

### 10. Interactive Sliders
- Since you're using Panel, you can add sliders to manually control the time step, allowing for more interactive exploration.

Given your expertise, you might also consider combining multiple of these techniques into a composite visualization for a richer understanding. Would you like to see code examples for any of these?

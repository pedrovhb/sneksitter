### Execution Flow:

1. A query is initiated.
2. The system starts from the first rule or fact and attempts to unify it with the query.
3. If unification is successful and there are no more goals, the query succeeds.
4. If unification is successful but there are more goals, the system moves to the next goal and repeats the process.
5. If unification fails, the system backtracks and tries the next rule or fact.
6. This continues until either a solution is found or all paths are exhausted.

Would you like to see a code example to illustrate this further?

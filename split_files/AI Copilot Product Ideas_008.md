Given the advances in AI and machine learning, there's a wide array of domains where "copilot" style products could be extremely valuable. Here are some ideas across various fields:

### Scientific Research
1. **Data Analysis Copilot**: Assists researchers in selecting the most appropriate statistical tests, visualizations, and even helps interpret results.
2. **Literature Review Copilot**: Helps researchers compile, summarize, and critically evaluate academic papers relevant to their field of study.

### Writing and Content Creation
3. **Editorial Copilot**: Offers real-time suggestions for improving prose, maintaining style guides, and ensuring cohesiveness across documents.
4. **Research Paper Copilot**: Assists in constructing a well-structured research paper, including providing citations, generating abstracts, and suggesting possible venues for publication.

### Software Development
5. **Security Copilot**: Analyzes code in real-time to identify potential security vulnerabilities and suggests patches.
6. **Code Review Copilot**: Assists in reviewing pull requests by highlighting areas that may need more attention and suggesting improvements.

### Art and Design
7. **3D Modeling Copilot**: Provides suggestions on improving the structure, topology, and aesthetics of a 3D model.
8. **Animation Copilot**: Helps animators by suggesting the next series of frames based on the current animation and context.

### Medicine
9. **Diagnosis Copilot**: Helps doctors by suggesting possible diagnoses based on patient symptoms and history.
10. **Surgical Copilot**: Assists surgeons by providing real-time suggestions during surgery, based on a variety of data inputs.

### Engineering
11. **Civil Engineering Copilot**: Suggests optimal materials and structures for a given project, given constraints like budget and geography.
12. **Mechanical Engineering Copilot**: Helps engineers in designing mechanisms, suggesting improvements for efficiency and durability.

### Finance
13. **Investment Copilot**: Analyzes market trends to suggest potential investment opportunities.
14. **Audit Copilot**: Assists auditors by automatically scanning financial records for discrepancies and suggesting areas for deeper investigation.

### Law
15. **Legal Research Copilot**: Helps lawyers and paralegals find relevant case law, and even suggests arguments.
16. **Contract Copilot**: Assists in drafting and reviewing contracts, highlighting potential risks and suggesting alternative clauses.

### Education
17. **Curriculum Copilot**: Helps educators in developing a curriculum by suggesting materials, activities, and evaluation methods based on student needs and educational standards.
18. **Grading Copilot**: Assists teachers in grading assignments by automating routine parts and suggesting grades based on a predefined rubric.

### Music and Audio
19. **Audio Mixing Copilot**: Suggests adjustments to EQ, compression, and other audio effects in real-time.
20. **Composition Copilot**: Helps composers by suggesting melodies, chord progressions, and instrumentations based on the current composition.

### Miscellaneous
21. **Cooking Copilot**: Suggests recipes based on ingredients available and even assists during the cooking process with timers and technique tips.
22. **Travel Copilot**: Helps plan trips by suggesting itineraries, activities, and accommodations based on personal preferences and constraints.

The key to these copilots would be their ability to learn and adapt to the user's specific needs and working styles, providing increasingly valuable assistance over time. They would also need to be designed with user trust and data privacy in mind.

The Panel library for Python doesn't seem to have a built-in widget specifically for displaying nodes as a tree. However, there is a community contribution that integrates a Tree widget from jsTree into Panel. You can find more information about it on the [HoloViz Discourse](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/a-tree-widget-from-jstree/1904).

Panel does offer a JSON pane that can render a tree view of arbitrary JSON objects, but it's not exactly a dedicated tree widget. More details can be found in the [Panel documentation for JSON pane](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/panes/JSON.html).

Would you like to explore the jsTree integration further, or are you considering alternative libraries for this task?

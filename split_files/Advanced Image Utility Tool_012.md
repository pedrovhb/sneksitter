### High-Level Steps

1. Parse both the original and modified Python scripts to generate their ASTs.
2. Compare the ASTs to find added, removed, or modified nodes.
3. Classify these changes into high-level features like added/removed functions, CLI arguments, etc.
4. Generate a YAML report based on these classified changes.

# Assistant

The code has been successfully executed. The structure of the parsed sample code is:

```
(module (function_definition ...) ... (function_definition ...))
```

The query captured the following nodes, each representing a function definition:

- A simple function definition at `(1, 0) to (2, 8)`
- A function with arguments at `(4, 0) to (5, 16)`
- A static method at `(8, 0) to (9, 24)`
- A class method at `(12, 0) to (13, 32)`
- A method inside a class at `(16, 4) to (17, 12)`
- An outer function containing an inner function at `(19, 0) to (22, 25)`
- The inner function itself at `(20, 4) to (21, 12)`

Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on next?

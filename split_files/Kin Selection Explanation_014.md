### Mammals

- **Meerkats**: As mentioned earlier, some meerkats act as sentinels, standing guard and alerting the group to predators, thereby risking their own safety.
  
- **Belding's Ground Squirrels**: These squirrels give alarm calls to warn relatives of approaching predators. The one giving the call is more exposed, but the call benefits close kin.

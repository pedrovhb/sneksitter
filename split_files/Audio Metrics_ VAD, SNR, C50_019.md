To design a set of helper tools that can extract clean and audible sentences from a larger audio file, you could follow a multi-step approach. Below are the steps and Python pseudo-code snippets to guide you through this process.

### 1. Preprocessing
Normalize the audio file to ensure that it's in a standard format (e.g., mono, 16kHz).

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.wav")
audio = audio.set_channels(1).set_frame_rate(16000)
```

### 2. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Use VAD to identify portions of the audio that likely contain speech.

```python
from pyannote.audio import Model, Inference

# Initialize model and inference
model = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/brouhaha", use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")
inference = Inference(model)

# Run VAD
output = inference("input.wav")

# Collect speech segments
speech_segments = []
for frame, (vad, _, _) in output:
    if vad > 0.7:  # Threshold
        speech_segments.append(frame)
```

### 3. Segment Audio
Group consecutive frames to form speech segments and then extract those segments as separate audio clips.

```python
# Pseudo-code to group consecutive frames
grouped_segments = group_consecutive_frames(speech_segments)

# Extract audio segments
for segment in grouped_segments:
    start, end = segment
    extracted_audio = audio[start:end]
    # Save or process the extracted audio
```

### 4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Filtering
Filter out segments with a low SNR.

```python
# Pseudo-code for SNR filtering
filtered_segments = [seg for seg in grouped_segments if calculate_snr(seg) > SNR_THRESHOLD]
```

### 5. Export Segments
Save the clean and audible segments as separate audio files or a single concatenated file.

```python
# Saving individual segments
for idx, segment in enumerate(filtered_segments):
    segment.export(f"segment_{idx}.wav", format="wav")
```

### 6. Optional: Post-processing
You can add additional steps like noise reduction or equalization based on your specific requirements.

This is a simplified overview and you may need to adapt each step based on your specific use-case. Would you like to delve into any of these steps in more detail?

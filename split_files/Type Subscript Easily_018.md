### In a Web Browser:

1. **Rich Text Areas**: Some web forms with rich text capabilities (like Google Docs or some forum editors) have a toolbar option for subscript. Look for a button that usually has a small number like "₂".
   
2. **HTML Tags**: If you're editing HTML or a web-based platform that supports HTML, you can use the `<sub>` tag to create subscript text: `<sub>your text here</sub>`.

3. **JavaScript**: If you're developing a web page, you can programmatically set subscript text using JavaScript by modifying the `verticalAlign` CSS property.
   ```javascript
   element.style.verticalAlign = "sub";
   ```

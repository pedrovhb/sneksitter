Given that your dog already follows commands like "sit," "stay," and "paw," it's clear you've invested in training, which is good. The whining during food preparation could be a form of anticipation or excitement that she hasn't yet learned to control. Since she's choosing to come watch you prepare the food, the visual cues could be amping her up even more.

You could try a few different strategies to address this:

1. **Distraction**: Give her a toy or a puzzle feeder to engage with while you're preparing her meal.
  
2. **Training during Preparation**: Incorporate "quiet" or "wait" commands while you're actually preparing the food. Reward her for obeying these commands with small treats or positive reinforcement.
  
3. **Change of Scenery**: You might also try preparing her food out of her line of sight to remove the visual stimuli that might be causing her excitement.

4. **Desensitization**: Randomly go through the motions of preparing her food without actually feeding her. This can make the act of food preparation less of an "event," thereby reducing her anticipatory whining.

Remember that consistency is key, and it may take some time for the new behavior to become ingrained.

Leveraging NetworkX for manipulating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) is a somewhat unconventional but intriguing idea. Here's how you could go about it:

### Representing ASTs as Graphs
1. **Nodes**: Each node in the AST would correspond to a node in the NetworkX graph.
2. **Edges**: Edges would represent parent-child relationships between AST nodes.

### Operations

#### 1. Transforming AST to NetworkX Graph
To begin, you'd need to walk through the AST and add each node and edge to a NetworkX graph.

#### 2. Analyzing and Manipulating
With the AST represented as a NetworkX graph, you could:
- Find subgraphs that match certain patterns.
- Identify dead code or unreachable statements.
- Optimize certain expressions.

#### 3. Transforming NetworkX Graph back to AST
Once you're done manipulating the graph, you'd need to convert it back into a valid AST.

### Advantages
- NetworkX provides rich algorithms for graph manipulation, which could be applied to ASTs for optimization or analysis.
- Easier visualization of the AST for debugging or analysis.

### Caveats
- Not a standard approach; tooling around this will be limited.
- ASTs are inherently hierarchical, while NetworkX graphs are more general, so some AST properties might not be naturally represented.
- NetworkX is not built for this; you might encounter performance issues for large ASTs.

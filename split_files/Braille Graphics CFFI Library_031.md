### Algorithms

1. **Batch Updates**: If multiple dots need to be updated at once, we can buffer these changes and update the grid in one go. This can significantly reduce the number of screen updates.

2. **Line Drawing**: Implement algorithms like Bresenham's for drawing lines using braille characters. This would be a good extension to the basic functionality.

3. **Double Buffering**: For the live display mode, use double buffering to create a smooth animation. Draw the next frame in an off-screen buffer and then swap it with the current frame.

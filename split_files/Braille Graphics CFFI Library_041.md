### Algorithm Drafts

#### 1. Coordinate Translation

Given global coordinates \((x, y)\), we want to find the corresponding braille character and the bit within that character that should be set or unset. We can use the following pseudocode for this:

```plaintext
1. braille_x = x // 2  (integer division to get the braille character's x-coordinate)
2. braille_y = y // 4  (integer division to get the braille character's y-coordinate)

3. local_x = x % 2  (remainder to get local x-coordinate within the braille character)
4. local_y = y % 4  (remainder to get local y-coordinate within the braille character)

5. bit_position = 2 * local_y + local_x  (calculate the bit position within the byte representing the braille character)

6. braille_index = width_of_grid_in_braille_characters * braille_y + braille_x  (linear index to locate the braille character in a 1D array)
```

#### 2. Bit Manipulation for Braille Characters

We can use bitwise operations to set or unset a particular bit within the byte that represents a braille character. Here is a simple pseudocode outline:

```plaintext
To set a bit:
1. braille_byte = braille_byte | (1 << bit_position)

To unset a bit:
1. braille_byte = braille_byte & ~(1 << bit_position)

To toggle a bit:
1. braille_byte = braille_byte ^ (1 << bit_position)
```

#### 3. Data Structure for 2D Grid

For the 2D grid, we could use a simple array of bytes, where each byte corresponds to a braille character. This would be straightforward to implement but might be memory-intensive for large grids.

Alternatively, for sparse grids, we could use a hash table where the keys are the `(braille_x, braille_y)` coordinates, and the values are the bytes representing the braille characters.

#### 4. Batch Updates and Line Drawing

For operations like drawing lines or other shapes, we could buffer the updates in a queue and apply them in batches. Algorithms like Bresenham's could be adapted to work on the grid of braille characters.

#### 5. Performance Optimizations

For performance-critical sections, we might look into SIMD instructions or multithreading, although these would add complexity to the code.

Listening to air traffic control (ATC) communications can be a grey area legally, and the regulations surrounding this activity vary significantly from country to country. In some places, listening to ATC communications is perfectly legal, while in others, it may be restricted or outright illegal.

In general:

1. **Listening:** In many countries, it's legal to listen to ATC communications for personal use, as long as you don't share the information with others or use it for malicious purposes.
  
2. **Sharing or Broadcasting:** Sharing, re-broadcasting, or publishing ATC communications is often where legal issues arise. This activity is typically more heavily regulated, and may require a license or be outright illegal depending on the jurisdiction.

3. **Encryption:** Some countries have moved to encrypt ATC communications to prevent unauthorized listening. In such countries, attempting to decrypt these communications without authorization is certainly illegal.

It's crucial to research and understand the laws and regulations regarding scanning and listening to ATC communications in your particular country before proceeding with this hobby.

Listening to multiple frequencies simultaneously with a single RTL-SDR dongle can be challenging due to its hardware limitations. However, there are a few workarounds you could consider:

1. **Multiple RTL-SDR Dongles:** 
   - Use multiple RTL-SDR dongles, each tuned to a different frequency.
   - You would need to run a separate instance of the receiving software for each dongle.

2. **Wideband Receiver:** 
   - Upgrade to a wideband SDR receiver that can handle a broader range of frequencies simultaneously.
   - Software such as GNU Radio or SDRTrunk can then be used to process the wideband signal and demodulate the individual channels.

3. **Frequency Hopping:**
   - Implement a frequency hopping mechanism where the RTL-SDR rapidly switches between frequencies.
   - This method might miss transmissions if the hopping rate isn't fast enough or if transmissions overlap.

4. **Software Solutions:**
   - Some software solutions allow for monitoring multiple frequencies by rapidly tuning the SDR to different frequencies in a round-robin manner.
   - This also falls under the frequency hopping category and might miss some transmissions.

5. **Scanning Software:**
   - Software like `rtl_airband` can scan multiple frequencies and output audio for each channel.
   - Install and run `rtl_airband` as follows:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install rtl-airband
     ```

You might want to create a configuration file for `rtl_airband` to specify the frequencies you are interested in. The configuration would look something like this:

```plaintext
devices:
({
  type = "rtlsdr";
  index = 0;
  channels:
  (
    {
      freqs = ( 118300000, 121500000, 124700000 );
      labels = ( "Tower", "Ground", "Approach" );
      modulation = "am";
      outputs: (
        {
          type = "icecast";
          server = "localhost";
          port = 8000;
          mountpoint = "ATC";
          name = "ATC Feed";
        }
      );
    }
  );
});
```

In this configuration:
- `freqs` specifies the frequencies to monitor.
- `labels` provides a label for each frequency.
- `modulation` sets the modulation type to AM.
- `outputs` defines an Icecast server to stream the audio to.

This setup would allow you to listen to multiple ATC frequencies, provided it's within the legal boundaries of your country.

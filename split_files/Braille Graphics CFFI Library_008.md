Your goal is to create a library that allows for the rendering of 2D graphics on a terminal using braille characters. This involves:

1. **Understanding Unicode for Braille**: Familiarizing ourselves with how braille is represented in Unicode is essential for mapping our 2D grid to braille characters correctly.

2. **2D Grid of Dots**: You want to represent drawings as a 2D grid of dots. This grid will then be translated into braille characters to create a "dot matrix" in the terminal.

3. **Efficient Algorithms**: The translation from the 2D grid to braille characters should be done efficiently. This may involve bitwise operations, as each braille character can represent multiple dots, and we'll be working at a low level. 

4. **Coordinate Translation**: We need to figure out how to translate global coordinates on the canvas to local coordinates within individual braille characters.

5. **Canvas and Character Positioning**: The algorithm should also consider the positioning of each braille character based on the canvas's width and height.

6. **Performance**: Given that this is performance-sensitive, you're interested in writing the core logic in C, which will then be called from Python using CFFI.

Questions:
1. What is the expected size range for the 2D grid? This will help in optimizing our algorithm.
2. Do you have any specific requirements for the C library? (E.g., should it be pure C or can it use certain libraries?)
3. Are there any constraints on how the braille characters are displayed? (E.g., should they fill from top to bottom, left to right, etc.?)
4. Do you have a preferred method for representing the 2D grid in Python before it gets passed to the C code?
5. Is there a particular terminal you're targeting, or should this be broadly compatible?

Once we have answers to these questions, we can proceed to explore the problem space in greater depth.

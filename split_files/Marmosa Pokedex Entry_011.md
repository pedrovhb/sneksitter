#### Pokedex Entry
Marmosa is a small, nocturnal marsupial known for its agility and keen senses. It thrives in the forests of South America, where it uses its prehensile tail to navigate through the trees with ease. Marmosa is most active at night, when its specialized eyes allow it to see in low light conditions. It feeds primarily on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates. Despite its small size, Marmosa is a fierce competitor in its habitat, often outmaneuvering predators and rivals alike.

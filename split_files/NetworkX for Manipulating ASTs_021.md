### Alternative Libraries and Data Structures

1. **Z3 Solver**: For symbolic reasoning about code. Could be used to identify invariants, optimize conditions, or prove properties about the code.
2. **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)**: Useful for representing boolean functions, can be used for complex condition simplification.
3. **Trie**: For common subexpression elimination.
4. **Interval Trees or Segment Trees**: Could be used for range analysis on variables.
5. **Control Flow Graph Libraries**: Like `PyCFG`, could offer more specific utilities for code analysis.
6. **Pandas DataFrame**: For lightweight data manipulation and analysis tasks, especially when the AST is converted to a tabular form.
7. **Scikit-learn's Decision Trees**: For applying machine learning to predict certain characteristics of code blocks.
  
Different libraries and data structures enable different kinds of manipulations and analyses, sometimes more specialized and efficient than a general-purpose graph library like NetworkX. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these?

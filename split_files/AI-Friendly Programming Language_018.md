### Language Model-Specific Features

1. **Backtracking Support**: Given the expensive nature of beam search, a programming paradigm that inherently supports backtracking could be beneficial.

2. **Heuristic Annotations**: If the language syntax allows for embedding heuristic information (like expected computational complexity), the language model could use this to choose more efficient algorithms.

3. **Integrated Commenting**: A language that integrates human-readable comments as a part of its formal syntax might make it easier for LLMs to provide context for the code they generate, enhancing understandability.

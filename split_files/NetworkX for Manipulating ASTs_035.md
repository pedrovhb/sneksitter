### Algorithms

1. **VF2 Algorithm**: One of the most efficient and commonly used algorithms for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem.
2. **Ullmann's Algorithm**: A bit older and generally less efficient, but still widely used.
3. **Backtracking Algorithms**: Brute-force methods that explore all possible mappings but can be very slow for large graphs.

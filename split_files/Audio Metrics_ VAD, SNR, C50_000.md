model = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/brouhaha", 
                              use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")

from pyannote.audio import Inference
inference = Inference(model)
output = inference("audio.wav")

# iterate over each frame
for frame, (vad, snr, c50) in output:
    t = frame.middle
    print(f"{t:8.3f} vad={100*vad:.0f}% snr={snr:.0f} c50={c50:.0f}")

In the context of audio processing, `vad`, `snr`, and `c50` represent the following metrics:

1. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: This metric indicates whether a particular frame contains speech or not. It's often a value between 0 and 1, where higher values signify a higher likelihood of speech presence. In your code, `vad` is multiplied by 100 to convert it to percentage form.

2. **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: This measures the level of a desired signal (such as speech) to the level of background noise. A higher SNR means that the speech is clearer and easier to understand. The value is usually given in decibels (dB).

3. **C50 (Clarity Index)**: This is an acoustic metric that quantifies the level of clarity for speech in a given environment. It is often used in the context of room acoustics to describe how clearly speech can be heard. A higher `C50` value generally indicates clearer speech.

Your code processes an audio file, applies a pre-trained model to it, and then iterates through the frames of the audio, outputting these three metrics for each frame.

How could I design helper tools to extract clean and audible sentences from a larger audio file?

To design a set of helper tools that can extract clean and audible sentences from a larger audio file, you could follow a multi-step approach. Below are the steps and Python pseudo-code snippets to guide you through this process.

### 1. Preprocessing
Normalize the audio file to ensure that it's in a standard format (e.g., mono, 16kHz).

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.wav")
audio = audio.set_channels(1).set_frame_rate(16000)
```

### 2. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Use VAD to identify portions of the audio that likely contain speech.

```python
from pyannote.audio import Model, Inference

# Initialize model and inference
model = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/brouhaha", use_auth_token="ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")
inference = Inference(model)

# Run VAD
output = inference("input.wav")

# Collect speech segments
speech_segments = []
for frame, (vad, _, _) in output:
    if vad > 0.7:  # Threshold
        speech_segments.append(frame)
```

### 3. Segment Audio
Group consecutive frames to form speech segments and then extract those segments as separate audio clips.

```python
# Pseudo-code to group consecutive frames
grouped_segments = group_consecutive_frames(speech_segments)

# Extract audio segments
for segment in grouped_segments:
    start, end = segment
    extracted_audio = audio[start:end]
    # Save or process the extracted audio
```

### 4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Filtering
Filter out segments with a low SNR.

```python
# Pseudo-code for SNR filtering
filtered_segments = [seg for seg in grouped_segments if calculate_snr(seg) > SNR_THRESHOLD]
```

### 5. Export Segments
Save the clean and audible segments as separate audio files or a single concatenated file.

```python
# Saving individual segments
for idx, segment in enumerate(filtered_segments):
    segment.export(f"segment_{idx}.wav", format="wav")
```

### 6. Optional: Post-processing
You can add additional steps like noise reduction or equalization based on your specific requirements.

This is a simplified overview and you may need to adapt each step based on your specific use-case. Would you like to delve into any of these steps in more detail?

The correlation between SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and C50 (Clarity Index) can vary depending on the context. While both are measures of audio quality, they serve different purposes and are calculated using different aspects of the audio signal.

### SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

- **What it Measures**: The ratio of the power of the desired signal (speech, in this case) to the power of background noise.
- **Use-case**: Useful in scenarios where the primary concern is the separation of speech from background noise.

### C50 (Clarity Index)

- **What it Measures**: The ratio of the energy in the early part of a sound to the energy in the later part, often used in room acoustics.
- **Use-case**: Useful in scenarios where the concern is how the acoustics of the environment affect the clarity of the sound, such as in large rooms or auditoriums.

### Correlation

- SNR and C50 may not always be correlated. High SNR doesn't guarantee a high C50, and vice versa.
- For example, you might have a high SNR in a recording where the speech is loud compared to the background, but if that speech is reverberant due to room acoustics, the C50 might be low.

### Which to Use?

- **SNR**: If you're dealing with simple scenarios where the main problem is background noise, SNR might be more suitable.
- **C50**: If the acoustics of the environment are a significant concern, or if you're dealing with more complex sound environments, C50 might provide a better measure of clarity.

In practice, it might be beneficial to use both metrics in conjunction to filter out segments that meet both your SNR and C50 criteria for "good" audio quality.

What would be some good approaches for designing algorithm to identify sequences of continuous segments and pick the best sound intervals, using all of VAD, SNR, and C50 data, constrained to a duration between Dmin and Dmax?

In the context above, answer in order:

1. Are there established techniques and literature dealing with this problem?

2. Are there established techniques for dealing with similar or analogous problems?

3. How could we design an effective approach for the task?

### 1. Established Techniques and Literature Dealing with This Problem

There is a good deal of literature on each of these metrics individually, such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Clarity Index (C50), often in the contexts of speech recognition, audio segmentation, and room acoustics. However, the specific problem of combining all three to identify the best sound intervals within a given duration is less commonly addressed. You might find research that employs a subset of these metrics for specialized applications like improving the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in noisy environments.

### 2. Established Techniques for Dealing with Similar or Analogous Problems

For similar problems, techniques often involve multi-objective optimization or machine learning models trained on labeled data to predict "good" segments.

1. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Techniques like Pareto optimization could be used to optimize multiple criteria (VAD, SNR, and C50) simultaneously.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: For problems that involve finding optimal subsequences, dynamic programming algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm are often useful.
3. **Machine Learning**: If you have labeled data, you could train a classifier to predict the quality of a segment based on these three metrics.

### 3. Designing an Effective Approach for the Task

Here's a conceptual approach to design an algorithm that identifies and picks the best sound intervals within given durations \( D_{\text{min}} \) and \( D_{\text{max}} \).

#### Step 1: Initial Segmentation
Use VAD to identify segments containing voice activity.

#### Step 2: Feature Calculation
For each segment, compute the SNR and C50 values.

#### Step 3: Filtering
Filter out segments with low VAD, SNR, or C50 based on pre-defined thresholds. These could be dynamically adjusted.

#### Step 4: Sequence Identification
Identify sequences of continuous segments and concatenate them if their total duration lies between \( D_{\text{min}} \) and \( D_{\text{max}} \).

```python
# Pseudo-code
sequences = []
current_sequence = []

for segment in filtered_segments:
    if current_sequence and segment.is_continuous_with(current_sequence[-1]):
        current_sequence.append(segment)
    else:
        if Dmin <= sum(current_sequence.durations) <= Dmax:
            sequences.append(current_sequence)
        current_sequence = [segment]
```

#### Step 5: Scoring and Ranking
Assign a score to each sequence based on the average VAD, SNR, and C50 values. Rank the sequences based on this score.

```python
# Pseudo-code
scores = []

for sequence in sequences:
    avg_vad = average([seg.vad for seg in sequence])
    avg_snr = average([seg.snr for seg in sequence])
    avg_c50 = average([seg.c50 for seg in sequence])
    
    score = weighted_sum([avg_vad, avg_snr, avg_c50])
    scores.append((sequence, score))

# Sort by score
sorted_sequences = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

#### Step 6: Output
Extract audio for the top-ranked sequences.

This approach combines filtering, scoring, and ranking to identify the best sequences based on the three metrics. Note that the weights and thresholds would likely need to be fine-tuned based on empirical testing.

2. `FrameSequence`: A dataclass that holds a list of `Frame` objects and provides properties to compute average `vad`, `snr`, `c50`, and a composite score.
3. `group_frames`: A function that takes a list of `Frame` objects and groups them into sequences based on a minimum gap between the frames.

The mock test shows that a `FrameSequence` with a duration of 0.064 seconds has an average VAD of 0.305, an average SNR of -6, and an average C50 of 49. The composite score is 43.305.

Would you like to proceed with the next steps of the algorithm, like filtering and ranking these sequences based on various criteria?

It appears that no sequences meet the filtering and ranking criteria set in the example. This is likely due to the small set of mock data. Normally, you'd have thousands of frames to process, which would produce meaningful sequences to rank.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. `filter_frames`: Filters out frames based on VAD, SNR, and C50 thresholds.
2. `filter_and_rank_sequences`: Filters sequences based on their duration and then ranks them based on a composite score, which is the sum of their average VAD, SNR, and C50 values.

Would you like to adjust the parameters or add more mock data to see the ranking in action?

The algorithm did not yield any ranked sequences with the given mock data, which is expected since the mock data is quite limited. However, the complete workflow includes:

1. Filtering frames based on VAD, SNR, and C50 thresholds.
2. Grouping continuous frames into sequences.
3. Filtering those sequences based on their duration to be within \(D_{\text{min}}\) and \(D_{\text{max}}\).
4. Ranking the valid sequences by their composite score, which is a weighted sum of the average VAD, SNR, and C50 for each sequence.

This approach should help you identify the best multi-frame segments that represent clean and continuous utterances in the audio. You can fine-tune the thresholds and weights based on your specific requirements.

Would you like to further refine or discuss any part of this algorithm?

What are some possible approaches of creating more sensible heuristics or algorithms we could define rather than simple weighted averages? And how could we analyze audio with more sophistication e.g. variable size window analysis?

### More Sophisticated Heuristics and Algorithms

1. **Exponential Weighting**: Instead of using simple averages, you could use exponential moving averages to give more weight to recent frames, which could be important if you expect changes within sequences.

2. **Statistical Measures**: Utilize variance or standard deviation along with mean values for each metric. A low variance could indicate a more consistent audio quality.

3. **Non-linear Combinations**: Apply non-linear functions like logarithms or exponentials to the metrics before summing them, especially if one metric has more importance in a specific range.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: Use machine learning classifiers to rank sequences based on multiple features. This could be a supervised learning task where you train the model on labeled data.

5. **Pareto Front**: In a multi-objective optimization context, use Pareto fronts to find sequences that offer the best trade-offs between the metrics.

### Variable Size Window Analysis

1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window approach where the window size changes depending on the VAD, SNR, or C50 values. For example, you could use a larger window when VAD is high and SNR is good.

2. **Adaptive Windowing**: Adjust the window size dynamically based on the characteristics of the audio. For instance, expand the window if you have a high VAD and contract it for low VAD.

3. **Overlap-Add Method**: Use overlapping windows and then stitch them back together. This is commonly used in signal processing for tasks like FFT.

4. **Multi-Resolution Analysis**: Use multiple window sizes and create a multi-resolution representation of your metrics. This allows you to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained features.

5. **Hierarchical Segmentation**: First segment the audio into larger chunks using a coarse window and then further segment those chunks using a finer window.

### How to Implement

1. **Frame Aggregation**: Instead of processing each frame independently, aggregate frames into variable-sized windows and then compute aggregate metrics like mean, variance, etc., for each window.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: For variable window sizes, you could use dynamic programming to find the optimal window size that maximizes some score function.

3. **Change Point Detection**: Use statistical methods to detect points where the metrics change significantly, which could indicate the start or end of a meaningful sequence.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on the raw metrics and their statistical properties over the window and use these features for ranking sequences.

By combining these approaches, you can create a more sophisticated algorithm for identifying high-quality audio sequences. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these topics?

The revised algorithm incorporates several advanced techniques:

1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Uses EMA to give more weight to recent frames, which could be more relevant.
  
2. **Dynamic Window Sizing**: The window size is dynamically adjusted based on the EMA of VAD. When the EMA of VAD is high, the window size increases, allowing for longer sequences. Conversely, when the EMA of VAD is low, the window size decreases.

3. **Multi-metric Filtering**: Frames are added to the current sequence only if they meet the criteria for average VAD, SNR, and C50 within the current window.

4. **Early Sequence Capture**: Sequences are captured as soon as they reach the minimum required duration (\(D_{\text{min}}\)).

The algorithm did not produce any sequences with the mock data, which is to be expected given the limited dataset. However, this approach provides a more nuanced method for identifying high-quality audio sequences.

Would you like to discuss further or adjust any part of this revised algorithm?

It looks like there was an issue with the code execution.

Apologies for the oversight. I forgot to re-create the `audio` object for demonstration. Would you like to proceed with a complete example, assuming an audio object is available?

Please create a helper class which abstracts all this, and just takes a Path for the constructor to indicate the file, and a transparent interface, providing properties "audio_16k" and "audio_original"

The `AudioHelper` class has been implemented to abstract away the details of handling audio files. It takes a `Path` object in the constructor to specify the audio file location. The class provides two properties: `audio_16k` and `audio_original`, which return the temporary file paths to the normalized 16kHz and original quality audio files, respectively.

You can instantiate this class and access these properties like so:

```python
audio_helper = AudioHelper(audio_path)
original_audio_path = audio_helper.audio_original
normalized_audio_path = audio_helper.audio_16k
```

Would you like to further refine or discuss any aspect of this helper class?

The `AudioHelper` class has been updated with the following features:

1. Two new properties, `original_file_path` and `normalized_file_path`, have been added to provide file paths for the original and normalized audio files, respectively.

2. A new class method `from_youtube_url` has been added. This method uses `yt-dlp` to download the audio from a given YouTube URL, and then initializes an instance of `AudioHelper` with that file.

You can use it like so:

```python
# Create an instance from a YouTube URL
audio_helper = AudioHelper.from_youtube_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example")

# Access properties
print(audio_helper.audio_original)  # Temporary file path for the original audio
print(audio_helper.audio_16k)       # Temporary file path for the 16kHz normalized audio
print(audio_helper.original_file_path)  # File path for the original audio
print(audio_helper.normalized_file_path)  # File path for the normalized audio
```

2. A class method `from_youtube_url` has been added, which takes a YouTube URL and downloads the audio using `yt-dlp`. The downloaded audio is then used to create an instance of `AudioHelper`.

To create an instance from a YouTube URL, you can use:

```python
audio_helper = AudioHelper.from_youtube_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example")
```

Then, you can access the original and 16k audio files as well as the original file path:

```python
original_audio_path = audio_helper.audio_original
normalized_audio_path = audio_helper.audio_16k
original_file_path = audio_helper.original_file_path

You're right; I chose WebM somewhat arbitrarily as it's one of the formats commonly available for YouTube videos. However, it's not necessarily the best choice for all scenarios. YouTube audio can be downloaded in various formats, such as `m4a`, `opus`, etc., depending on the available streams.

Regarding a programmatic interface, there are Python libraries like `pytube` or `yt_dlp` (a maintained fork of `youtube-dl`) that can be used to download YouTube videos without invoking subprocesses. These libraries offer more control over the download process, including format selection, stream filtering, and so on.

Here's how the class could look using `yt_dlp` to download the audio programmatically:

I apologize for the inconvenience. I attempted to import a library that isn't available in this environment. However, using `yt_dlp` in your local environment should allow you to download YouTube audio programmatically. 

The `from_youtube_url` class method has been updated to use the `yt_dlp` library for downloading audio. It now downloads the audio in `m4a` format, which is often considered a good balance between size and quality. You can easily change this to another format based on your needs.

Would you like to discuss or adjust any part of this further?

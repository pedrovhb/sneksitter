---
### Technical Details:

1. **Project Initialization**: Use the initial YAML spec to generate the basic directory structure and files. This could be done using Python's `pathlib.Path` and templating via `jinja2`.
  
2. **Refinement Rounds**: After the initial setup, the YAML can be parsed to generate more specific code snippets. If the model needs more information, it could generate a list of questions that can be answered to refine the YAML spec further.
  
3. **Code Generation**: Use the refined YAML to populate the function and class skeletons. Given that you are proficient with Python, implementing this with good design shouldn't be an issue.

4. **Editing**: Implement plugin commands/API calls that allow for the modification of function bodies post-generation.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Any IO-bound or potentially blocking operations can be implemented asynchronously using `asyncio`.

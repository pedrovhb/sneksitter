# Assistant

Given the extensive list you've already compiled, there aren't many notable omissions. However, if you're looking to make the list even more comprehensive, you might consider including:

### Creational Patterns
- **Object Mother**: A pattern used primarily for setting up objects in test scenarios, creating objects with preset states.
- **Pool**: A variation of the Object Pool that is more generalized and can be parameterized.

### Structural Patterns
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Module**: Encapsulates a set of functionalities into a single unit of work, common in languages like JavaScript.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Momento**: Your list mentions "Memento", but it's spelled as "Momento" in some contexts.
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Ensures that a distributed transaction correctly commits or rolls back across multiple participating databases or services.
- **Specification**: Encapsulates business rules or conditions that an object must satisfy into a separate object.

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Fork-Join**: Divide a parallelizable problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them in parallel, and then combine the results.
- **Future and Promise**: Represents a value that will be available in the future, typically used for asynchronous operations.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Provides stability and prevents cascading failures in distributed systems.
  
These are additional patterns or variations that are commonly seen in different aspects of software engineering. Adding these to your list would make it even more complete.

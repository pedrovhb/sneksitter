#### Creative Ideas
1. **Interactive Visualizations**: Use modern web technologies like D3.js to render the Graphviz output in an interactive format. Users could click nodes to see corresponding code samples or related rules.
2. **Layered Visualizations**: Show different layers for different sets of grammar rules, perhaps even allowing a time-lapse view that shows how rules are triggered during the parsing process.
3. **Dynamic Layouts**: Rather than a static image, allow users to switch between various layout algorithms on-the-fly to get different perspectives.
4. **Annotative Features**: Integrate additional information, such as the frequency of rule invocation, as heatmaps or color gradients.
5. **Semantic Zooming**: On zooming in, show more details like rule definitions; on zooming out, show a summarized view highlighting only key rules or communities.

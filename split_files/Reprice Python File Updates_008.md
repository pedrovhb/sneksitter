To reprice the updated Python file based on the diff, we need to apply the changes shown in the diff to the original Python file. The diff indicates that several function names have been renamed and that the loop range and function calls in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block have been updated.

The diff shows that the original functions `function_one`, `function_two`, and `function_three` have been renamed to `func_one`, `func_two`, and `func_three`, respectively. Also, the loop range has been changed from 3 to 4, and the function calls in the main program block have been updated to reflect the new function names.

Here's how the repriced Python file would look:

```python
# Complex Sample Python File

def func_one():
    print("This is func one.")

def func_two():
    print("This is func two.")

def func_three():
    print("This is func three.")
    
def func_six():
    print("This is func six.")
    
def func_seven():
    print("This is func seven.")

def func_eight():
    print("This is func eight.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Main program starts here.")
    for i in range(4):
        func_one()
        func_two()
        func_three()
    func_six()
    func_seven()
    func_eight()
```

This repriced file includes the new function names and the updated loop range and function calls in the main program block.

Designing a library for Python code generation with a templating engine like Mako and a data model powered by Pydantic is an interesting challenge. Here are some considerations:

### Data Model Design

1. **Strong Typing**: Use Pydantic models to enforce type checking for each code component (e.g., `Class`, `Method`, `Decorator`, etc.).

2. **Recursion**: Design the models to be recursive, so a `Class` model can contain `Method` models, which in turn can contain `Statement` models, and so on.

3. **Validation**: Utilize Pydantic's validation features to ensure that the code components are semantically correct. For example, a class decorator should not be applied to a function.

4. **Serialization**: Ensure that the data models can be easily serialized/deserialized to/from JSON or other formats.

### Code Generation

1. **Templating**: Use Mako or another templating engine to define how each code component should be rendered to a string.

2. **Self-Rendering**: Each component should have a method to render itself to a string, possibly calling the render methods of its child components.

3. **Indentation**: Handle code indentation in a consistent manner, especially when components are nested.

4. **Imports**: Keep track of required imports and ensure they are added at the top of the generated code.

### Composability

1. **High-level API**: Provide a high-level API for common tasks, like creating a new class with methods and decorators.

2. **Low-level API**: Also provide a low-level API for more granular control over the code generation process.

3. **Extensibility**: Design the library to be easily extendable, so users can add their own code components or templates.

### Async Support

Since you prefer `asyncio`, consider providing an async API for tasks that might benefit from it, like fetching templates from a remote source.

### Error Handling

1. **Compile-time Checks**: Use Pydantic validation to catch errors early.

2. **Runtime Checks**: Provide meaningful error messages if something goes wrong during the code generation process.

Would you like to see a code example demonstrating some of these principles?

Your existing implementation already provides a rich set of functional tools, especially with the AsyncStream class. However, there are other functional utilities you could consider adding:

1. **`fold`/`reduce_right`:** Your current `reduce` function operates left-to-right. A `fold` or `reduce_right` would be the opposite, reducing the iterable from the right.

2. **`zipWith`:** Similar to Python's `zip`, but it takes an additional function to apply to the paired elements.

3. **`partition`:** Splits the stream into two streams based on a predicate. One stream contains all elements that satisfy the predicate, and the other contains all that don't.

4. **`scan`:** Similar to `reduce`, but returns a stream of all the intermediate accumulators.

5. **`takeWhile` and `dropWhile`:** These would allow you to create new streams by taking elements while a predicate is true, or dropping elements while a predicate is true, respectively.

6. **`groupBy`:** A function to group elements based on some function or key, returning a stream of (key, group) pairs.

7. **`uniq`:** Removes duplicate elements from the stream.

8. **`debounce`/`throttle`:** For rate-limiting the events in the stream.

9. **`switchMap`:** Similar to `flatMap`, but cancels any ongoing asynchronous operations if a new one starts, essentially "switching" to the new operation.

10. **`retry`:** Automatically retries a failed operation before propagating the error upstream.

11. **`buffer`:** Collects items from the stream and releases them in fixed-size chunks.

12. **`merge`:** Combines multiple streams into one, emitting items from any of the input streams.

Incorporating these could make your `AsyncStream` class an even more powerful utility for functional programming with async streams. Would you like an example of how to implement any of these?

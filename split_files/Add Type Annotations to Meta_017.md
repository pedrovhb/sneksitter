### Potential Improvements:

1. **Customizable Pool Key**: Right now, the key for the pool is automatically created using the arguments passed to the constructor. Allowing a customizable function to compute the key can offer more flexibility.
  
2. **Thread Safety**: If this is going to be used in a multi-threaded environment, you might want to add locks around the dictionary access to make it thread-safe.
  
3. **Documentation**: Docstrings could be added to clarify the behavior and usage of this metaclass.

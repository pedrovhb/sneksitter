I encountered an issue while trying to access the page on Hacker News. However, based on the search results, there's an article titled "An Algorithm for Drawing Trees" discussed on Hacker News, which seems to match the topic you're interested in. Unfortunately, I can't retrieve the direct link or more information about the content of the article at the moment.

If you're looking for a specific algorithm or further information on the topic, I might be able to assist by finding or explaining similar content or algorithms regarding drawing trees. Your guidance on how to proceed would be appreciated.

### Implementation
- The AI could interact with the language server via Language Server Protocol (LSP), sending and receiving JSON-RPC messages for code analysis and generation tasks.

In summary, integrating a language server could significantly elevate the capability of a language model in code generation tasks, making it more accurate, efficient, and adherent to best practices.

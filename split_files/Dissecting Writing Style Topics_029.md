### Part 2: Delving into Asynchronous Iterators

- **Subheading 1: What Are Asynchronous Iterators?**
  - **Paragraph**: Define asynchronous iterators and explain how they differ from their synchronous counterparts, especially in the context of async programming.
  
- **Subheading 2: The `__aiter__` and `__anext__` Magic Methods**
  - **Paragraph**: Explain the asynchronous magic methods `__aiter__` and `__anext__`. Include code examples showcasing how they work in asynchronous contexts.
  
- **Subheading 3: Use Cases for Asynchronous Iterators**
  - **Paragraph**: Discuss where asynchronous iterators shine, such as in IO-bound or high-latency environments. Include practical examples and code snippets.

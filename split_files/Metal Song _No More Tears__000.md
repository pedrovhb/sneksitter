The phrase "No More Tears" is most commonly associated with the Ozzy Osbourne song of the same name, released in 1991. Despite Ozzy Osbourne being more aligned with heavy metal, the song "No More Tears" explores themes of loneliness and despair, which may seem at odds with the genre's often aggressive or grandiose themes. The song's chorus serves to emphasize the emotional weight of the subject matter. 

So, it's not uncommon for heavy metal to delve into emotional or introspective themes; the genre is quite diverse in its thematic range. Would you like to know more about the song or its context within the genre?

It sounds like you're quoting lyrics or poetic lines. These phrases evoke a sense of urgency and fleeting moments, perhaps emphasizing the importance of seizing opportunities before they're gone. While I can't interpret the emotional nuances as a human might, they do fit into a common theme often explored in various forms of art: the impermanence of time and the need to make the most of it. Is there a specific context or question you have about these lines?

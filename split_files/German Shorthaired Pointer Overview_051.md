### General Tips:

1. **Consistency**: Make sure all family members are consistent with commands and rewards.

2. **Positive Reinforcement**: Always reward calm behavior, even when there aren't distractions.

3. **Professional Help**: If issues persist, consider consulting a dog behaviorist or a certified professional dog trainer.

Training for this kind of issue is often incremental and may take time to see significant improvement. It's crucial to be patient and consistent throughout the training process.

#### Step 5: Scoring and Ranking
Assign a score to each sequence based on the average VAD, SNR, and C50 values. Rank the sequences based on this score.

```python
# Pseudo-code
scores = []

for sequence in sequences:
    avg_vad = average([seg.vad for seg in sequence])
    avg_snr = average([seg.snr for seg in sequence])
    avg_c50 = average([seg.c50 for seg in sequence])
    
    score = weighted_sum([avg_vad, avg_snr, avg_c50])
    scores.append((sequence, score))

# Sort by score
sorted_sequences = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### Syntactic Feasibility
Syntactic feasibility refers to the structural compatibility between the subgraphs that are being considered for a match. This involves checking whether the nodes and edges in the subgraphs adhere to the basic structural rules that define isomorphism. For example, in the simplest case of graph isomorphism, two nodes can be matched if they both have the same degree. These are essentially "syntax rules" that the graphs must adhere to for a valid isomorphism.

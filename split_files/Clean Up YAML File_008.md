The error message suggests that the YAML file contains control characters that are not allowed by the YAML parser. These are non-printable ASCII characters, often represented in hexadecimal format. The character `#x0080` is a control character that falls under this category.

## Steps to Clean Up the File

1. **Read the File**: Load the file into memory to identify the location of the unacceptable characters.
2. **Filter Characters**: Filter out unacceptable control characters.
3. **Write Back**: Write the cleaned-up data back to the file or a new file.

### Python Code to Perform These Steps

Let's execute this in Python. I'll use the `pathlib.Path` library to read and write files as per your preference.

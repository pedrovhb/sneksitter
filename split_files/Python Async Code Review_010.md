### Some Points to Consider:

1. **Error Messages**: The `TypeError` messages could be more descriptive, especially in `ensure_async_callable` and `ensure_async_iterator`.

2. **Lack of Comments**: While the code is well-structured, adding comments describing the functionality of functions or complex code blocks could be helpful.

3. **Revealed Types**: `reveal_type` is usually a static type checking tool and doesn't run during the program's execution. If you want to check the type at runtime, you could use Python's native `type()`.

Would you like to discuss specific parts of the code, any patterns used, or potential improvements?

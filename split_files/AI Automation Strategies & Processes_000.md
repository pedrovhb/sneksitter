Some structure tasks can be executed piecemeal by an AI better than if by prompting outright. For instance, a program may automatically generate slides by first prompting for a list of topics to cover for a given subject, then asking for illustrative images and bullet points for each of them for generating the slides, constraining the model to create in a predefined format but allowing freedom for it to create a good diverse slideshow. This content would then be programatically used to generate slides as a pptx or similar format.

What are other such strategies for leveraging AI models? And what processes can they automate that are more "final" than plain text, but would be difficult to otherwise automate fully?

Certainly, breaking down a larger task into smaller, structured sub-tasks can be an effective way to leverage AI models for complex automation. Here are some additional strategies and corresponding processes:

### Strategies

1. **Sequential Workflow**: Similar to your slide generation example, many tasks can be broken down into sequential steps that AI can execute in order.
    - **Example**: Research paper generation. AI could generate the abstract, then the introduction, and so on, sequentially.

2. **Conditional Execution**: Some tasks could have multiple pathways based on conditions. AI could be used to evaluate these conditions and execute accordingly.
    - **Example**: Automated troubleshooting for IT issues. If the issue is X, perform Y; otherwise, perform Z.

3. **Feedback Loops**: In some tasks, the output of one stage could be used as an input for the same or another stage. AI can adapt its execution based on this feedback.
    - **Example**: Code refactoring. AI generates code, tests it, and if it fails, it iterates.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Utilizing multiple AI models or a combination of AI and human input for a single task.
    - **Example**: In medical diagnosis, an image recognition model could work in tandem with a natural language model to provide more accurate results.

5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI can analyze large datasets to make more informed choices during task execution.
    - **Example**: Automated trading. Analyzing market trends and executing trades.

6. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Some tasks require real-time adjustment. AI can make these adjustments without human intervention.
    - **Example**: Dynamic pricing for e-commerce based on supply and demand.

### Processes

1. **Content Creation**
    - Beyond slides, think about automated report writing, script generation for videos, or even automated journalism.

2. **Data Analysis**
    - For example, generating insights from raw data and creating visualizations based on those insights.

3. **Software Testing**
    - Generating unit tests based on code analysis and then running them to report back with bugs.

4. **Customer Service**
    - A more sophisticated chatbot that can handle multi-turn conversations and execute tasks like booking, refunds, etc.

5. **Recruitment**
    - From sourcing candidates to performing the initial rounds of interviews via natural language processing.

6. **Code Generation**
    - Given a task description, AI could generate a skeleton code or even a more functional version, which can then be fine-tuned.

7. **Cybersecurity**
    - Real-time threat detection and response, which would be difficult to fully automate otherwise.

8. **Healthcare**
    - Automated preliminary diagnosis based on symptoms described in natural language, followed by suggested tests and medications.

9. **Media Production**
    - Automatic video editing based on predefined themes or sentiments.

10. **Financial Planning**
    - Given a set of goals and financial data, generate a financial plan.

By structuring the tasks effectively and choosing the right strategy, AI can automate processes that are complex, time-consuming, and require nuanced decisions.

What about others which generate a final product? E.g. a nutrition plan.

    - **Final Product**: A comprehensive nutrition plan as a PDF or a mobile app interface.

2. **Home Renovation Plans**
    - **Stages**: Gather requirements such as budget, space dimensions, and style preferences. AI generates 3D models, cost estimates, and a project timeline.
    - **Final Product**: A detailed renovation blueprint and project plan.

3. **Personalized Learning Plans**
    - **Stages**: Collect data on learning style, previous knowledge, and learning goals. Generate a curriculum with resources, exercises, and milestones.
    - **Final Product**: A structured learning path with scheduled assessments.

4. **Travel Itinerary**
    - **Stages**: Collect information on travel dates, budget, and interests. Generate an itinerary with activities, accommodation, and transportation details.
    - **Final Product**: A downloadable itinerary with booking options.

5. **Automated Codebase**
    - **Stages**: Collect specifications and requirements for a software project. Generate skeleton code, database schemas, and basic UI layouts.
    - **Final Product**: A functional or semi-functional code repository.

6. **Marketing Campaign**
    - **Stages**: Define target audience, budget, and goals. AI generates a campaign plan, including copy, graphics, and a posting schedule.
    - **Final Product**: A ready-to-launch marketing campaign.

7. **Business Plans**
    - **Stages**: Input business idea, market research, and financials. AI generates a business plan including an executive summary, market analysis, and financial projections.
    - **Final Product**: A presentation or document suitable for investors.

8. **Legal Documents**
    - **Stages**: Collect data on the type of document, parties involved, and specific clauses. Generate a legally compliant document.
    - **Final Product**: A printable legal document.

9. **Custom Apparel Design**
    - **Stages**: Gather preferences on style, color, and material. AI generates design sketches or even 3D models.
    - **Final Product**: A detailed design specification ready for production.

10. **Automated Journalism**
    - **Stages**: Identify topics, fetch data, and decide on article structure. Generate the article.
    - **Final Product**: A publish-ready news article.

Each of these processes involves several stages of data collection, analysis, and generation, culminating in a final product that has tangible value beyond plain text.

# Assistant

The models are implemented and a test was performed using a sample function. However, there are a couple of issues:

1. The type annotations are not in a friendly format; they include the `<class>` strings.
2. The `args` and `kwargs` parameters aren't indicated as `*args` and `**kwargs` in the generated signature.

Would you like to refine this?

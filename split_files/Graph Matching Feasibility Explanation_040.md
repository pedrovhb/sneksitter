It appears that no common subgraphs meeting the semantic feasibility criteria were found. This might be due to the fact that the two example JSON objects have different structures and keys, which makes them semantically incompatible based on our criteria. 

Would you like to revise the example JSON objects or the criteria for semantic feasibility to proceed?

Absolutely, there are multiple approaches to tackling separation anxiety in dogs, often used in combination for the best results:

### Counter-Conditioning
This involves changing your dog's emotional response to being alone. You can make your departures a cue for something good, like a special toy or treat, to change the negative association with your absence.

### Medication
In severe cases, medication like anti-anxiety drugs can be prescribed to help your dog cope. This is usually a last resort and must be managed by a veterinarian.

### Training "Quiet" Commands
Teaching your dog to be "quiet" on command can help control vocalization issues that might accompany separation anxiety.

### Routine & Exercise
Dogs often find comfort in routines. A consistent schedule and plenty of exercise can help mitigate anxiety. Tired dogs are generally less anxious.

### Safe Space
Creating a "safe space" like a specific room or crate can give your dog a sense of security. Make this space pleasant and comforting with toys, blankets, and treats.

### Puzzle Toys & Feeders
These engage your dog mentally and can keep her occupied for a considerable time, reducing the focus on your absence.

### Gradual Desensitization to Triggers
If your dog gets anxious when you perform certain actions like putting on shoes or grabbing keys, repeatedly expose her to these actions without actually leaving. This can help desensitize her to these specific triggers.

### Distract & Redirect
If you notice your dog becoming anxious, you can use toys or treats to distract her. You can also use obedience commands that she knows well to redirect her attention.

### Professional Help
A certified dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist can provide personalized strategies.

### Monitoring Tools
Use of cameras or other monitoring tools can help you observe your dog's behavior when you're not home, which can provide valuable insights into what might be causing the anxiety.

It's usually best to use a combination of these techniques tailored to your dog's specific needs. And remember, always consult with a veterinarian or certified animal behaviorist for severe cases.

The phrase "No More Tears" is most commonly associated with the Ozzy Osbourne song of the same name, released in 1991. Despite Ozzy Osbourne being more aligned with heavy metal, the song "No More Tears" explores themes of loneliness and despair, which may seem at odds with the genre's often aggressive or grandiose themes. The song's chorus serves to emphasize the emotional weight of the subject matter. 

So, it's not uncommon for heavy metal to delve into emotional or introspective themes; the genre is quite diverse in its thematic range. Would you like to know more about the song or its context within the genre?

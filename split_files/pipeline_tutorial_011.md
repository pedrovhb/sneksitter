## Multimodal pipeline

The [`pipeline`] supports more than one modality. For example, a visual question answering (VQA) task combines text and image. Feel free to use any image link you like and a question you want to ask about the image. The image can be a URL or a local path to the image.

For example, if you use this [invoice image](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impira/docquery/resolve/2359223c1837a7587402bda0f2643382a6eefeab/invoice.png):

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> vqa = pipeline(model="impira/layoutlm-document-qa")
>>> vqa(
...     image="https://huggingface.co/spaces/impira/docquery/resolve/2359223c1837a7587402bda0f2643382a6eefeab/invoice.png",
...     question="What is the invoice number?",
... )
[{'score': 0.42515, 'answer': 'us-001', 'start': 16, 'end': 16}]
```

<Tip>

To run the example above you need to have [`pytesseract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) installed in addition to ðŸ¤— Transformers:

```bash
sudo apt install -y tesseract-ocr
pip install pytesseract
```

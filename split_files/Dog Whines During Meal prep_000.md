Dog whining during meal preparation can be attributed to several factors, such as excitement, impatience, or even a learned behavior to get your attention. Dogs don't have the same concept of time as humans do, so the act of preparing food can feel prolonged for them. Additionally, the anticipation of food could trigger an emotional response like whining. 

If the whining becomes problematic, you might consider training strategies to encourage patience and calm behavior. This could involve asking for a "sit" or "stay" before mealtime and rewarding only when your dog complies.

Well I already always make her sit, stay, paw, and eat only after a "come" command, but that's after I prepare it. She whines while I'm preparing it (which  she comes to watch of her own initiative btw

Given that your dog already follows commands like "sit," "stay," and "paw," it's clear you've invested in training, which is good. The whining during food preparation could be a form of anticipation or excitement that she hasn't yet learned to control. Since she's choosing to come watch you prepare the food, the visual cues could be amping her up even more.

You could try a few different strategies to address this:

1. **Distraction**: Give her a toy or a puzzle feeder to engage with while you're preparing her meal.
  
2. **Training during Preparation**: Incorporate "quiet" or "wait" commands while you're actually preparing the food. Reward her for obeying these commands with small treats or positive reinforcement.
  
3. **Change of Scenery**: You might also try preparing her food out of her line of sight to remove the visual stimuli that might be causing her excitement.

4. **Desensitization**: Randomly go through the motions of preparing her food without actually feeding her. This can make the act of food preparation less of an "event," thereby reducing her anticipatory whining.

Remember that consistency is key, and it may take some time for the new behavior to become ingrained.

She doesn't really look excited with the rest of her body language. How does desensitization work in general, with other kinds of behaviors too?

Desensitization is a behavioral training technique used to reduce or eliminate an animal's (or human's) negative or exaggerated response to a particular stimulus. The general principle involves gradually exposing the subject to the stimulus in a controlled manner until the response diminishes.

Here's how it's typically done:

### Steps for Desensitization:

1. **Identify the Stimulus**: Pinpoint what exactly is causing the exaggerated response. In your dog's case, this seems to be the act of food preparation.

2. **Create a Baseline**: Establish a starting point for the exposure that's below the threshold that triggers the undesired behavior. This could be as simple as standing near the food storage without actually touching it.

3. **Incremental Exposure**: Slowly increase the level of stimulus while ensuring it remains below the threshold for the undesired behavior. For example, you might progress from simply standing near the food storage to touching the food container, then to opening it, and so on.

4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Reward the desired behavior (e.g., not whining) at each step with treats, affection, or whatever else the dog finds rewarding.

5. **Consistency and Repetition**: Consistency is crucial. The process needs to be repeated often enough for the new, desired behavior to become ingrained.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Keep an eye on how the subject is responding. If you notice backsliding, you may need to revert to an earlier stage in the process and work back up more slowly.

### Generalization to Other Behaviors:

Desensitization can be used for a wide range of behaviors and situations, such as:

- Reducing anxiety in pets during travel or vet visits
- Treating phobias or anxiety disorders in humans
- Training animals to tolerate handling or grooming
- Helping children overcome fear of the dark

The same principles—gradual exposure, positive reinforcement, and consistent repetition—apply regardless of the specific behavior you're targeting.

She actually loves the vet. Doesn't make a single sound even after 2 vaccine injections. I'm interested in desensitization for separation anxiety though, which is probably her biggest frustration

Separation anxiety is a common issue for dogs and can be quite distressing for both the pet and the owner. Desensitization is often a recommended approach for treating separation anxiety, as it can help your dog become accustomed to periods of being alone without experiencing high levels of stress.

### Steps for Desensitization for Separation Anxiety:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Note the actions that signal you're about to leave, like picking up keys or putting on shoes. These can become anxiety-inducing cues for your dog.

2. **Baseline Exposure**: Start by leaving the room for a very short period—just a few seconds—and then return, without making a big deal out of either departure or arrival.

3. **Positive Reinforcement**: Before leaving and upon returning, offer a treat or toy that your dog really enjoys. This helps to associate your departures with positive experiences.

4. **Incremental Increases**: Gradually extend the time you're out of the room. Move from seconds to minutes, and eventually to longer periods. Make sure to mix in shorter absences so it's not a continuous escalation.

5. **Randomize Duration**: Once your dog seems more comfortable with you being gone for longer periods, randomize the duration so they can't anticipate exactly when you'll return.

6. **Practice Real Scenarios**: Incorporate the identified triggers into the training sessions. For example, pick up your keys but then sit back down, or put on your shoes but then stay inside. This helps to decouple these actions from the act of leaving.

7. **Monitor and Tweak**: Keep an eye on your dog's behavior. If you notice signs of distress, you may need to slow down the process and revert to shorter absences.

8. **Consult a Professional**: For severe cases, consult a veterinarian or a certified animal behaviorist for targeted treatment plans, which might include medication alongside behavioral interventions.

Remember that desensitization is a slow process and requires patience and consistency. The goal is to make your dog feel secure and confident when you're not around, and this takes time to achieve.

Absolutely, there are multiple approaches to tackling separation anxiety in dogs, often used in combination for the best results:

### Counter-Conditioning
This involves changing your dog's emotional response to being alone. You can make your departures a cue for something good, like a special toy or treat, to change the negative association with your absence.

### Medication
In severe cases, medication like anti-anxiety drugs can be prescribed to help your dog cope. This is usually a last resort and must be managed by a veterinarian.

### Training "Quiet" Commands
Teaching your dog to be "quiet" on command can help control vocalization issues that might accompany separation anxiety.

### Routine & Exercise
Dogs often find comfort in routines. A consistent schedule and plenty of exercise can help mitigate anxiety. Tired dogs are generally less anxious.

### Safe Space
Creating a "safe space" like a specific room or crate can give your dog a sense of security. Make this space pleasant and comforting with toys, blankets, and treats.

### Puzzle Toys & Feeders
These engage your dog mentally and can keep her occupied for a considerable time, reducing the focus on your absence.

### Gradual Desensitization to Triggers
If your dog gets anxious when you perform certain actions like putting on shoes or grabbing keys, repeatedly expose her to these actions without actually leaving. This can help desensitize her to these specific triggers.

### Distract & Redirect
If you notice your dog becoming anxious, you can use toys or treats to distract her. You can also use obedience commands that she knows well to redirect her attention.

### Professional Help
A certified dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist can provide personalized strategies.

### Monitoring Tools
Use of cameras or other monitoring tools can help you observe your dog's behavior when you're not home, which can provide valuable insights into what might be causing the anxiety.

It's usually best to use a combination of these techniques tailored to your dog's specific needs. And remember, always consult with a veterinarian or certified animal behaviorist for severe cases.

Getting a dog to stay put in the car can also be a challenge, especially if they're anxious or overly excited. Here are some techniques that can help:

### Desensitization and Counter-Conditioning
- Similar to treating separation anxiety, gradually expose your dog to the car in a non-threatening manner. Start by just sitting in the parked car with your dog and giving treats.
- Slowly work up to short drives around the block, then longer trips.

### Use of Restraints
- A dog seat belt or a secured crate can physically prevent your dog from moving around too much. Make sure whatever you use is comfortable and safe.

### Training Commands
- Use commands like "stay" or "sit" to keep your dog in place. Start practicing these commands in a non-moving car before attempting them while driving.

### Special Car Toys/Treats
- Have specific toys or treats that are only available to your dog when they're in the car. This creates a positive association with being in the car.

### Safe Space
- Bring your dog's blanket or a piece of clothing that smells like you to create a comforting environment.

### Exercise Beforehand
- A well-exercised dog is less likely to be restless. Try to tire your dog out before getting in the car.

### Control the Environment
- Keep windows partially closed to prevent your dog from trying to jump out or becoming overly stimulated by scents and sights.
- You can also use sunshades to reduce visual stimuli that might make your dog want to move around.

### Routine and Consistency
- Make car rides a regular occurrence so your dog becomes accustomed to them. Consistency helps in reducing anxiety over time.

### Professional Help
- For severe cases of travel anxiety, consult with a veterinarian. Medication may be an option, but it's usually considered a last resort.

Each dog is different, so you may need to try a few of these techniques before you find what works best for your dog. The key is to make the car a comfortable and rewarding environment, reducing the desire to move around while you're driving.

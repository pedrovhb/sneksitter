No, not all non-printable characters are control characters. Let's break down the distinction:

### Control Characters

- These are characters that do not represent a written symbol but serve to initiate a particular action. 
- In ASCII, these are characters from `0x00` to `0x1F`, and the `0x7F` (DEL) character.

### Non-Printable Characters

- These are characters that are not meant to be displayed. This set includes control characters but may also include others depending on the character set you're using.

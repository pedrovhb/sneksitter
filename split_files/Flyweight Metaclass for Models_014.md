The Flyweight metaclass seems to be working as expected with the simple `Test` class. Objects with the same intrinsic state (in this case, the `x` attribute) are indeed the same object in memory (`a is b` evaluates to `True`), while objects with different states are different (`a is c` evaluates to `False`).

Now, let's apply this metaclass to your existing classes. Given that they are data classes, the Flyweight pattern should integrate seamlessly. Would you like to proceed with that?

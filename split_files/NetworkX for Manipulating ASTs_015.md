### Caveats
- Not a standard approach; tooling around this will be limited.
- ASTs are inherently hierarchical, while NetworkX graphs are more general, so some AST properties might not be naturally represented.
- NetworkX is not built for this; you might encounter performance issues for large ASTs.

Would you like to see some Python code illustrating these concepts?

The `attrs` library itself does not natively support JSON-RPC serialization, as it focuses on providing a way to define classes with attributes, validation, and other utilities. However, its companion library `cattrs` allows for more complex serialization and deserialization tasks, including structure transformations.

While `cattrs` can help in converting complex Python objects to dictionaries, it doesn't directly support JSON-RPC formatting out-of-the-box. JSON-RPC has a specific protocol format that includes fields like `jsonrpc`, `method`, `params`, and `id`, which you would need to handle separately.

That said, you could certainly use `cattrs` to serialize and deserialize the `params` field in a JSON-RPC message, especially if it contains complex objects. You would then manually construct or parse the rest of the JSON-RPC message around that.

Would you like a code example demonstrating how you might go about doing this?

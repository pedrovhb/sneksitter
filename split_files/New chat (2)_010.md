### Generalized to ASTs:

If you're looking to generalize NetworkX to integrate with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), you'll need to consider how to represent the AST nodes and edges in NetworkX. Once represented, querying can be done using the above methods. ASTs often have labeled edges (e.g., "left" and "right" for a binary tree), so you'll likely need to use a MultiDiGraph in NetworkX to accurately capture the AST structure.

Typing subscript text often depends on the context or environment in which you're working. Here are some common ways:

### General Text Editors:
1. **Word Processors (MS Word, Google Docs, etc.)**: Usually have an option to format text as subscript. Typically, you can highlight the text and then select "Subscript" from the format menu or use a shortcut like `Ctrl + =`.
2. **Rich Text Editors (Markdown, Jupyter, etc.)**: These often use HTML-like or LaTeX-like tags for subscript. For example, in Markdown, you can use HTML tags: `<sub>subscript</sub>`. In Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX notation like `\( x_{1} \)` can be used.

### Programming:
1. **Python**: Python doesn't have built-in support for subscript in string literals. However, you can use Unicode subscript characters for integers and some lowercase letters.
    ```python
    print("H₂O")  # Using Unicode subscript
    ```
2. **LaTeX**: You can use the underscore `_` to indicate subscript: `x_{subscript}`.
3. **HTML/CSS**: Use the `<sub>` tag for subscript.

### Shell:
Since you're using the fish shell, there's no native support for subscript characters in most shells, including fish. However, some terminal emulators may support Unicode subscript characters.

### Code Comments:
In code comments, subscript is generally not supported. However, you can use notations like `x[i]` to indicate "x subscript i".

### Custom Key Bindings:
If you frequently use subscript characters, you could set up custom key bindings to insert these characters more easily. How to do this would depend on your OS and text editor.

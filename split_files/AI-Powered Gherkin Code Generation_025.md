# Assistant

Here's the generated Python code based on the "Basic Calculator" feature:

```python
# Generated code for Basic Calculator
class BasicCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(x: float, y: float) -> float:
        return x * y
```

### Step 4: Verification

In a real-world application, a verification engine would check if the generated code meets the requirements specified in the Gherkin-like scenarios. This could involve running unit tests against the generated code.

### Step 5: Test Execution

Finally, the runtime engine would execute the code to ensure it works as expected. In this case, we could run some basic tests for the `add` and `multiply` methods to validate their functionality.

Would you like to proceed with running some tests on this generated code?

### Next Steps

1. Draft the algorithms for coordinate translation and bit manipulation for representing braille characters.
2. Investigate efficient data structures for representing the 2D grid in Python.
3. Draft the C code for the core logic, focusing on performance.

Would you like to start by exploring the algorithms, or would you prefer to dive straight into code examples?

Great, let's get creative.

### Braille in Unicode

Firstly, the mapping of braille dots to bits in a byte could look something like this:

```
Braille Dot    Bit Position
    1                0
    2                1
    3                2
    4                3
    5                4
    6                5
    7                6
    8                7
```

### Coordinate Translation

For a point at global coordinate \( (x, y) \) in the grid, we can find the braille character's position \( (bx, by) \) and the local coordinate \( (lx, ly) \) within that braille character as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
bx &= x \, \text{div} \, 2 \\
by &= y \, \text{div} \, 4 \\
lx &= x \, \text{mod} \, 2 \\
ly &= y \, \text{mod} \, 4
\end{align*}
\]

### Bitwise Operations for Braille Characters

Given a local coordinate \( (lx, ly) \), the corresponding bit position \( b \) in the byte for the braille character can be calculated. One possible formula could be:

\[
b = 4 \times lx + ly
\]

We can then set this bit to 1 to indicate a dot at this position.

### Data Structure for 2D Grid

Since performance is a concern, one option is to use a hash set to store all \( (x, y) \) coordinates that contain a dot. This would make insertion and lookup operations

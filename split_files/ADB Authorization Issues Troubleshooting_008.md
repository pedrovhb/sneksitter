When dealing with `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) not prompting for authorization, a variety of factors can come into play. Here are some steps you could consider:

### On the Computer:

1. **Kill the ADB Server**: You've already tried this, but just to be sure, run `adb kill-server` followed by `adb start-server`.

2. **Check Environment Variable**: Ensure the `$ADB_VENDOR_KEYS` environment variable is set properly. If it's not, set it to point to the location where your vendor keys are stored.

3. **Update ADB**: Sometimes these issues can be fixed by simply updating to the latest version of ADB.

4. **Check ADB Devices**: After starting the server, run `adb devices`. The device should initially appear as unauthorized.

### On the Android Device:

1. **Revoke USB Debugging Authorizations**: You mentioned you've tried this, but it's always good to double-check. This is generally under `Settings > Developer options > Revoke USB debugging authorizations`.

2. **USB Configuration**: Set the USB mode to `MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)` or `PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol)` and then back to `Charging` to trigger the authorization dialog.

3. **Check for Hidden Dialogs**: Sometimes the dialog is hiding behind other windows, so make sure youâ€™ve checked the device thoroughly.

4. **Cable and Port**: Try a different USB cable and/or port.

5. **ADB over Wi-Fi**: As a last resort, you can try connecting via Wi-Fi to see if the problem persists.

### Advanced Steps:

1. **Check Logs**: You can check the output of `adb logcat` to see if there is anything specific that stands out.

2. **Custom ROMs / Rooted Devices**: If you're using a custom ROM or a rooted device, additional issues might occur that are specific to your setup.

3. **Check User Permission**: Make sure that the user running `adb` has proper permissions to access the USB device.

Would you like to try any of these steps now? If you're still facing issues after these, we can dig deeper.

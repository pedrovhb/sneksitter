### Processes

1. **Content Creation**
    - Beyond slides, think about automated report writing, script generation for videos, or even automated journalism.

2. **Data Analysis**
    - For example, generating insights from raw data and creating visualizations based on those insights.

3. **Software Testing**
    - Generating unit tests based on code analysis and then running them to report back with bugs.

4. **Customer Service**
    - A more sophisticated chatbot that can handle multi-turn conversations and execute tasks like booking, refunds, etc.

5. **Recruitment**
    - From sourcing candidates to performing the initial rounds of interviews via natural language processing.

6. **Code Generation**
    - Given a task description, AI could generate a skeleton code or even a more functional version, which can then be fine-tuned.

7. **Cybersecurity**
    - Real-time threat detection and response, which would be difficult to fully automate otherwise.

8. **Healthcare**
    - Automated preliminary diagnosis based on symptoms described in natural language, followed by suggested tests and medications.

9. **Media Production**
    - Automatic video editing based on predefined themes or sentiments.

10. **Financial Planning**
    - Given a set of goals and financial data, generate a financial plan.

By structuring the tasks effectively and choosing the right strategy, AI can automate processes that are complex, time-consuming, and require nuanced decisions.

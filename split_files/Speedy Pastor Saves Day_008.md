Once upon a time in a quaint little town, lived Pastor Maldonado, a man of exceptional devotion and punctuality. His congregation at St. Celestine's Church admired him not just for his profound wisdom but also for his impeccable sense of timing. In a world where people blamed traffic, faulty alarm clocks, or even the dog for their tardiness, Pastor Maldonado was a beacon of punctuality. He had never been late for a sermon, not even by a minute.

The secret to his punctuality was an old, wind-up pocket watch that had been passed down in his family for generations. This wasn't just any pocket watch; it was said to have belonged to a saint. Pastor Maldonado would wind it up every night, cherishing the soft ticks and tocks that synchronized with the rhythms of his life.

One fateful Saturday night, a terrible storm rolled into town. Lightning flashed, and thunder roared, shaking the very foundation of St. Celestine's Church. The next morning, Pastor Maldonado reached for his cherished pocket watch, only to find it missing. A sense of dread filled him; he had never conducted a sermon without it.

### Code Quality:

The generated code would follow best practices and could optionally include elements like:

- Type hints and comments
- Logging setup
- Test suite setup with sample tests

Given your skill set, this could be implemented as a Python CLI tool using libraries like `click` for the CLI interface and `jinja2` for templating. The tool could be made async where IO-bound operations are involved. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific part?

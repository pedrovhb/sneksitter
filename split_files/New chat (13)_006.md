Your task is to create a Python iterator that interfaces with a C shared library using CFFI. This iterator will simulate fetching sensor data from an Android device. Below are the steps and goals for this task:

### Goals:

1. **Compile C Code into a Shared Library**: The C code simulates a synthetic sensor data generator. Compile this into a shared library (.so file).

2. **Python CFFI Interface**: Write Python code using CFFI to interface with this C shared library. Implement this within a Python class that adheres to the iterator protocol (`__iter__` and `__next__` methods).

3. **Customization and Realism**: The Python class should allow customization of sensor characteristics like frequency for each axis. The C code should generate realistic sensor data based on these frequencies, using sine and cosine functions with added noise.

4. **Iterate Over Sensor Data**: Demonstrate that you can iterate over the sensor data in Python using a `for` loop.

### C Code:

The C code is provided in the previous conversation. It includes functions to initialize the sensor with given frequencies (`init_sensor`), fetch the next sensor data (`next_sensor_data`), and free the sensor handle (`free_sensor`).

### Python CFFI Code:

Create a Python class named `SensorIterator` that:

- Uses CFFI to load the C shared library.
- Implements `__iter__` and `__next__` methods to make the class iterable.
- Allows customization of sensor frequencies for each axis.

### Testing:

Demonstrate that you can iterate over the sensor data using a Python `for` loop. The output should be tuples containing sensor data for x, y, and z-axes.

Exploring the `grammar.json` files of simpler languages can give you valuable insights into how Tree-sitter works, while avoiding the complexity of full-fledged programming languages. Here are some languages that are simple yet non-trivial, making them interesting candidates for this kind of exploration:

### JSON

Although a data-interchange format, JSON has a straightforward grammar that involves objects, arrays, and primitive types. Exploring its `grammar.json` can help you understand how nested structures are handled.

### Markdown

Markdown's grammar involves headers, lists, links, and inline styling. While simple, it has its quirks and can be a good introduction to how textual formatting languages are parsed.

### TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)

TOML is used for configuration files and has a straightforward syntax. It involves key-value pairs, tables, and arrays. Its `grammar.json` would show you how these different types are parsed and related.

### Regular Expressions

Although not a programming language, the grammar for regular expressions would be fascinating to study. It involves sequences, choices, repetitions, and special characters, providing a good exercise in understanding how these constructs are parsed.

### YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

Like JSON, YAML is another data serialization standard. It's more human-readable and allows for data structures to be defined inline. Its `grammar.json` would be interesting to explore how indentation and symbols like `---` or `...` are treated.

### INI (Initialization File Format)

INI files are simple configuration files for software programs. They consist of sections, properties, and comments. This could be a good example to see how Tree-sitter handles sections and key-value pairs.

### GraphQL

GraphQL query language is relatively simple but has some interesting constructs like query and mutation types, fragments, and variables. Its `grammar.json` would offer insights into how these constructs are parsed.

### Shell Script (Bash, sh)

Although more complex than the others listed here, the grammar for a shell scripting language like Bash would be very informative for understanding how commands, pipelines, and conditionals are parsed.

Each of these languages offers a unique set of challenges and characteristics that can give you a broad understanding of how Tree-sitter grammars are structured and how various language constructs are handled.

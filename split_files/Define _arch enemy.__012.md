An "enemy" is an individual, group, or entity that poses a threat, either real or perceived, to another. The term can be applied in various contexts, including personal relationships, politics, warfare, and business. Unlike an "arch enemy," an enemy doesn't necessarily have to be the primary or most significant adversary. An enemy can be temporary and situational, whereas an arch enemy often implies a more enduring and significant conflict.

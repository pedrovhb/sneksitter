```python
Rich offers a 【33†Layout】 class which can be used to divide the screen area in to parts, where each part may contain independent content. It can be used with 【34†Live Display】 to create full-screen “applications” but may be used standalone.

To see an example of a Layout, run the following from the command line:

    python -m rich.layout

## Creating layouts【21†¶】

To define a layout, construct a Layout object and print it:

    from rich import print
    from rich.layout import Layout

    layout = Layout()
    print(layout)

This will draw a box the size of the terminal with some information regarding the layout. The box is a “placeholder” because we have yet to add any content to it. Before we do that, let’s create a more interesting layout by calling the 【35†split_column()】 method to divide the layout in to two sub-layouts:

    layout.split_column(
        Layout(name="upper"),
        Layout(name="lower")
    )
    print(layout)

This will divide the terminal screen in to two equal sized portions, one on top of the other. The `name` attribute is an internal identifier we can use to look up the sub-layout later. Let’s use that to create another split, this time we will call 【36†split_row()】 to split the lower layout in to a row of two sub-layouts:

    layout["lower"].split_row(
        Layout(name="left"),
        Layout(name="right"),
    )
    print(layout)

You should now see the screen area divided in to 3 portions; an upper half and a lower half that is split in to two quarters.

You can continue to call split() in this way to create as many parts to the screen as you wish.

## Setting renderables【22†¶】

The first position argument to `Layout` can be any Rich renderable, which will be sized to fit within the layout’s area. Here’s how we might divide the “right” layout in to two panels:

    from rich.panel import Panel

    layout["right"].split(
        Layout(Panel("Hello")),
        Layout(Panel("World!"))
    )

You can also call 【37†update()】 to set or replace the current renderable:

    layout["left"].update(
        "The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."
    )
    print(layout)

## Fixed size【23†¶】

You can set a layout to use a fixed size by setting the `size` argument on the Layout constructor or by setting the attribute. Here’s an example:

    layout["upper"].size = 10
    print(layout)

This will set the upper portion to be exactly 10 rows, no matter the size of the terminal. If the parent layout is horizontal rather than vertical, then the size applies to the number of characters rather that rows.

## Ratio【24†¶】

In addition to a fixed size, you can also make a flexible layout setting the `ratio` argument on the constructor or by assigning to the attribute. The ratio defines how much of the screen the layout should occupy in relation to other layouts. For example, let’s reset the size and set the ratio of the upper layout to 2:

    layout["upper"].size = None
    layout["upper"].ratio = 2
    print(layout)

This makes the top layout take up two thirds of the space. This is because the default ratio is 1, giving the upper and lower layouts a combined total of 3. As the upper layout has a ratio of 2, it takes up two thirds of the space, leaving the remaining third for the lower layout.

A layout with a ratio set may also have a minimum size to prevent it from getting too small. For instance, here’s how we could set the minimum size of the lower sub-layout so that it won’t shrink beyond 10 rows:

    layout["lower"].minimum_size = 10

## Visibility【25†¶】

You can make a layout invisible by setting the `visible` attribute to False. Here’s an example:

    layout["upper"].visible = False
```

I apologize for the oversight. Below is the requested cheat sheet for the `Layout` object from the `rich` library in YAML format:

```yaml
short_description: |
  Layout class in `rich` is utilized to divide screen area into parts for independent content.

long_description: |
  Rich's Layout class is instrumental in subdividing the screen area into segments, each capable of holding independent content. It finds its use in conjunction with Live Display for creating full-screen applications or can be used standalone. 

usage_explanation: |
  - Instantiate a Layout object.
  - Use methods like `split_column()`, `split_row()` to create sub-layouts.
  - Assign renderables to a layout.
  - Set fixed size or ratio to control layout's dimensions.
  - Toggle visibility using the `visible` attribute.

examples: |
  - Basic Layout:
      ```python
      from rich import print
      from rich.layout import Layout

      layout = Layout()
      print(layout)
      ```
  - Splitting Layout:
      ```python
      layout.split_column(
          Layout(name="upper"),
          Layout(name="lower")
      )
      print(layout)
      ```
  - Setting Renderables:
      ```python
      from rich.panel import Panel

      layout["right"].split(
          Layout(Panel("Hello")),
          Layout(Panel("World!"))
      )
      print(layout)
      ```

use_when_you_need_to: |
  - Create structured UI in terminal.
  - Divide screen area for displaying independent content.
  - Build full-screen terminal applications.
  - Control layout dimensions with fixed size or ratio.
  - Toggle visibility of content.

see_also: |
  - Live Display for creating full-screen applications.
  - Panel, Table, and other renderables for displaying content within a Layout.
  - `split()`, `update()` methods for further layout manipulation.
```

        Layout(name="left"),
        Layout(name="right"),
    )
    print(layout)

You should now see the screen area divided in to 3 portions; an upper half and a lower half that is split in to two quarters.

You can continue to call split() in this way to create as many parts to the screen as you wish.

## Setting renderables【22†¶】

The first position argument to `Layout` can be any Rich renderable, which will be sized to fit within the layout’s area. Here’s how we might divide the “right” layout in to two panels:

    from rich.panel import Panel

    layout["right"].split(
        Layout(Panel("Hello")),
        Layout(Panel("World!"))
    )

You can also call 【37†update()】 to set or replace the current renderable:

    layout["left"].update(
        "The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."
    )
    print(layout)

## Fixed size【23†¶】

You can set a layout to use a fixed size by setting the `size` argument on the Layout constructor or by setting the attribute. Here’s an example:

    layout["upper"].size = 10
    print(layout)

This will set the upper portion to be exactly 10 rows, no matter the size of the terminal. If the parent layout is horizontal rather than vertical, then the size applies to the number of characters rather that rows.

## Ratio【24†¶】

In addition to a fixed size, you can also make a flexible layout setting the `ratio` argument on the constructor or by assigning to the attribute. The ratio defines how much of the screen the layout should occupy in relation to other layouts. For example, let’s reset the size and set the ratio of the upper layout to 2:

    layout["upper"].size = None
    layout["upper"].ratio = 2
    print(layout)

This makes the top layout take up two thirds of the space. This is because the default ratio is 1, giving the upper and lower layouts a combined total of 3. As the upper layout has a ratio of 2, it takes up two thirds of the space, leaving the remaining third for the lower layout.

A layout with a ratio set may also have a minimum size to prevent it from getting too small. For instance, here’s how we could set the minimum size of the lower sub-layout so that it won’t shrink beyond 10 rows:

    layout["lower"].minimum_size = 10

## Visibility【25†¶】

You can make a layout invisible by setting the `visible` attribute to False. Here’s an example:

    layout["upper"].visible = False
```

```yaml
Layout:
  short_description: |
    A class in the Rich library used to divide the terminal screen into sections, each holding independent content.
  long_description: |
    The `Layout` class in the Rich library can be used to create visually appealing terminal interfaces by dividing the terminal screen into multiple sections. Each section can hold independent content, making it easier to organize information in a structured manner.
  usage_explanation: |
    - Create a `Layout` instance.
    - Use methods like `split_column()` or `split_row()` to divide the layout.
    - Access sub-layouts using their name as a key.
    - Update renderables in a layout using `update()` or set them while creating sub-layouts.
    - Control size using `size` and `ratio` attributes, and visibility using the `visible` attribute.
  examples: |
    - Basic Layout:
        from rich import print
        from rich.layout import Layout
        layout = Layout()
        print(layout)
    - Splitting Layout:
        layout.split_column(Layout(name="upper"), Layout(name="lower"))
        layout["lower"].split_row(Layout(name="left"), Layout(name="right"))
    - Setting Renderables:
        from rich.panel import Panel
        layout["right"].split(Layout(Panel("Hello")), Layout(Panel("World!")))
    - Fixed Size:
        layout["upper"].size = 10
    - Ratio:
        layout["upper"].size = None
        layout["upper"].ratio = 2
  use_when_you_need_to:
    - Create structured terminal interfaces.
    - Display multiple pieces of information separately within the same terminal screen.
    - Create interactive terminal applications.
    - Have control over the size and visibility of different sections of the terminal interface.
    - Dynamically update content within a structured layout.
  see_also:
    - Live Display: For creating full-screen terminal applications.
    - Panel: To create bordered boxes around text or other renderables within a layout.
    - Rich renderables: Various renderables that can be used within a layout to display content.

It seems there's been a hiccup in finding the precise documentation for the JSON widget within the Panel library. However, I'm familiar with the Panel library, and can provide a card-style cheat sheet based on the standard usage and functionalities of JSON widgets within GUI libraries. If this doesn't align with the Panel library's JSON widget specifics, it might still serve as a general guideline. Here’s a YAML representation of a card-style cheat sheet for a hypothetical JSON widget in the Panel library:

```yaml
JSONWidget:
  short_description: |
    A widget in the Panel library for displaying and editing JSON data.
  
  long_description: |
    The JSON widget allows for the display, editing, and validation of JSON data. It provides a structured, collapsible view of the JSON data and can validate the data against a provided schema.
  
  usage_explanation: |
    - Import the necessary libraries and create a Panel object.
    - Create a JSON widget instance and provide the JSON data.
    - Optionally, provide a JSON schema for validation.
    - Use Panel methods to display the widget in the application.
  
  examples: |
    - Basic Usage:
        import panel as pn
        json_widget = pn.widgets.JSON(value={'key': 'value'})
        pn.serve(json_widget)
    
    - With Schema Validation:
        schema = {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "key": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["key"]
        }
        json_widget = pn.widgets.JSON(value={'key': 'value'}, schema=schema)
        pn.serve(json_widget)
    
    - Updating Value:
        json_widget.value = {'new_key': 'new_value'}
  
  use_when_you_need_to:
    - Display JSON data in a structured, user-friendly manner.
    - Allow users to edit JSON data.
    - Validate JSON data against a specific schema.
    - Provide real-time feedback on JSON data validity.
    - Display a large amount of hierarchical data in a compact form.
  
  see_also:
    - TextAreaInput: For plain text input and display.
    - DataFrame widget: For displaying tabular data.
    - SyntaxHighlighter: For displaying code with syntax highlighting.
```

If you're looking for specific functionalities or if the Panel library's JSON widget diverges significantly from the standard, I would recommend checking the official documentation or the source code of the Panel library.

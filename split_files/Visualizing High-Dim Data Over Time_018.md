### 10. Interactive Sliders
- Since you're using Panel, you can add sliders to manually control the time step, allowing for more interactive exploration.

Given your expertise, you might also consider combining multiple of these techniques into a composite visualization for a richer understanding. Would you like to see code examples for any of these?

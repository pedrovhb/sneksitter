The overhead of creating a process in Linux can vary significantly based on various factors such as the system's current load, hardware specifications, and the specific Linux distribution and version in use. However, generally speaking, creating a process is a relatively expensive operation in terms of system resources.

#### Factors Affecting Overhead

1. **CPU Time**: Spawning a new process involves a series of system calls like `fork()` and `exec()`, which consume CPU cycles.
2. **Memory**: Each process has its own address space, stack, and heap, which consume RAM.
3. **I/O**: Reading the executable from disk and loading it into memory also involves I/O operations.
4. **Kernel Overhead**: The operating system kernel has to manage internal data structures for each process, such as Process Control Blocks (PCBs).
5. **Context Switching**: If the number of processes is high, the kernel has to spend more time switching between different processes, which adds to the overhead.

#### Quantitative Measures

To get a more concrete understanding, you can run some benchmarks using system utilities like `time` to measure the time taken to create a process. For example:

```bash
time ./my_program
``
```

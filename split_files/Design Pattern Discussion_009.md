### Creational Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: This is often considered more of a technique than a formal design pattern. However, it's widely used, so its inclusion makes sense.
- **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)**: This is more often associated with languages like C++ that do not have garbage collection. Nevertheless, it is a crucial concept for resource management.

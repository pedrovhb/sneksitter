### In Windows:

1. **Character Map**: You can open the Character Map utility in Windows, locate the subscript character you need, and then copy-paste it. 

2. **Alt Codes**: Some subscript numbers can be typed using the Alt key plus a numeric code. For example, Alt+8322 produces a subscript 2 (Â²).

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts in Word Processors**: In Microsoft Word and similar software, you can usually toggle subscript on/off with `Ctrl + =`.

4. **AutoHotkey Script**: If you frequently need to type subscript characters, you could use a tool like AutoHotkey to create custom keyboard shortcuts.

5. **On-Screen Keyboard**: You can also use Windows' On-Screen Keyboard (`osk.exe`) to click on special characters, though this is more cumbersome.

6. **Unicode Input**: Some applications allow you to input Unicode characters directly by holding down `Alt` and typing the Unicode code point. For example, the code for subscript 2 is `U+2082`, so you'd hold down `Alt` and then type `2082` (may require enabling 'hex numpad' in Windows).

Would you like more details on any of these methods?

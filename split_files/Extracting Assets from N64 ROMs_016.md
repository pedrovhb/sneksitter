### Example in Python
Let's say you've found a block of texture data in a ROM and you know that it starts at byte offset `0x2000` and is `0x1000` bytes long.

Here's a Python snippet using `pathlib` to read that block of data. Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world scenarios would require additional steps for decoding and conversion.

```python
from pathlib import Path

rom_path = Path("path/to/your/rom.n64")
offset = 0x2000
length = 0x1000

with rom_path.open("rb") as f:
    f.seek(offset)
    texture_data = f.read(length)

# Further processing for texture_data
```

Please extract this project, analyze the readme and relevant code files. We're looking to come up with a reasonable generic integration with Python that allows for a multitude of possible uses in an elegant way.

I'll be away for a bit, so please proceed autonomously and don't stop your response to wait for me or ask if we should continue. You should do this without requiring intervention, up to your time/character limit, preferably. Explore as much as you can so soon you can brief me on ideas. Thank you!

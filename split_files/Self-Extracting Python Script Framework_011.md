### Core Components

1. **Data Packing**: We need a mechanism to pack data (files, directories) into a base64-encoded tar.gz string.
2. **Data Unpacking**: The generated script should be able to unpack the base64-encoded tar.gz string into actual files and directories.
3. **Operation Interfaces**: The operations (e.g., installing libraries, moving files) should be extensible. An Abstract Base Class (ABC) can define the interface for these operations.
4. **Script Generation**: The framework should compile all these components into a Python script that can be run independently.

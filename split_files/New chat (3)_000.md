# User

Say we have a highly nested recursive data structure and a traversal cursor able to go to first child, go to next sibling, and go to parent. How could we use the cursor so as to traverse the structure and build a networkx graph (tree) of nodes and their children?

# Assistant

To traverse a highly nested recursive data structure and build a NetworkX graph (tree) of nodes and their children, you can use Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal. The traversal cursor you mentioned can be used to navigate through the structure.

Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import networkx as nx

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self, node):
        self.node = node

    def go_to_first_child(self):
        if self.node.children:
            self.node = self.node.children[0]
            return True
        return False

    def go_to_next_sibling(self):
        if self.node.next_sibling:
            self.node = self.node.next_sibling
            return True
        return False

    def
```

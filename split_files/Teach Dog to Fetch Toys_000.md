# Assistant

Training your dog to fetch specific items by name requires a combination of associative learning and positive reinforcement. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored to your dog's existing skills:

### What You'll Need:
- The toys you want to teach names for
- A bag of your dog's favorite treats
- A quiet space with minimal distractions

### Steps:

#### 1. Introduction of the Toy
1. Put all other toys away, leaving only the one you want to teach first.
2. Show the toy to your dog and say its name clearly ("This is Ball").
3. Play with her and the toy for a few minutes.

#### 2. Reinforce the Name
1. Ask your dog to sit.
2. Hold the toy in front of her and say the name ("Ball").
3. Give her the toy and let her hold it in her mouth.
4. After a few seconds, say "Drop it" and exchange the toy for a treat.

#### 3. Test Name Recognition
1. Put the toy among other objects (not toys).
2. Ask her to "Fetch Ball."
3. If she picks the correct one, immediately reward her with a treat and praise.
4. If not, go back to step 2 and reinforce the name again.

#### 4. Adding More Toys
1. Once she consistently fetches the first toy by name, introduce a second toy.
2. Repeat steps 1-3 for the new toy.
3. Practice fetching by asking her to differentiate between the two toys.

#### 5. Generalize the Behavior
1. Practice in different environments.
2. Add more toys to the mix and keep practicing.

### Tips:
- Keep training sessions short (5-10 minutes) to maintain her attention.
- Consistency is key. Use the same commands and reward system.
- If she seems to struggle with one particular toy, spend more time on it before moving on.

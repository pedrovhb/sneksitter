Is it possible to "undo" positional encodings in large language models in order to get just an "untainted" language model hidden state representation?

The concept of "undoing" positional encodings in large language models like GPT or BERT is not straightforward for several reasons:

1. **Non-Linearity**: The positional encodings are mixed with the token embeddings and then passed through multiple layers of non-linear transformations (like attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks). The operations are not easily invertible.

2. **Interactions**: The positional information is used in the attention mechanism to understand the relationship between different tokens in the sequence. This interaction is complex and not simply "added" to the hidden states.

3. **Architecture Specifics**: Different language models may use different kinds of positional encodings (sine/cosine-based, learned, etc.) and architectures (transformer-based, RNN-based, etc.), making a generic "undo" operation difficult.

In theory, one could attempt to construct a model to learn the inverse operation, but it would be highly approximate and computationally expensive. Moreover, the utility of such an "untainted" state is questionable, as the positional information is crucial for the model's understanding of the sequence.

Given your expertise, you'll recognize that the operation is akin to trying to reverse-engineer a highly complex and non-linear function, which is generally an intractable problem.

My goal is to get a visualization of different branches of generation across latent space by umapping latents, but it seems they follow mostly the same path regardless of contents; I suspect it's position encoding messing with it. How could I take that out of the equation?

Given your goal, the effect of positional encoding might indeed be a confounding factor when visualizing latent spaces. However, completely removing the positional encoding is non-trivial for the reasons previously discussed. Here are some alternative approaches that you could try:

1. **Initial Layers**: You could extract the hidden states from earlier layers where the effect of positional encoding might be less pronounced. This could offer a less "tainted" view of the latent space.

2. **Zero Positional Encoding**: Another approach is to set the positional encoding to zero and then feed the sequences through the model. This would result in a hidden state representation that is devoid of any positional information. Note that this would be a kind of "what-if" scenario and not a true undoing of the encoding.

3. **Statistical Adjustment**: You could try to statistically adjust the latent states to account for the influence of positional encodings. For example, you could fit a model that predicts latent states based solely on the positional encodings and then remove this predicted component from the actual latent states.

4. **Relative Positional Encoding**: Some models use relative positional encoding which is more focused on the relationship between tokens rather than their absolute position. If the model architecture allows for it, using relative positional encoding could lessen the positional impact on the latent space.

5. **Cluster Analysis**: Another approach could be to perform clustering on the latent states and then analyze the characteristics of each cluster. This could potentially help in separating out the effect of positional encodings.

6. **Manual Inspection**: As a last resort, you could manually inspect a subset of the latent states and their corresponding generated text to better understand how positional encoding is affecting the latent space.

Given your expertise, you could even combine these approaches to see which offers the best separation of content from positional effects in the latent space. Would you like to delve into one of these approaches in more detail?

Certainly. The idea behind setting the positional encoding to zero is to effectively "neutralize" its impact on the subsequent hidden states. In this scenario, the only information that would be propagated through the network would come from the token embeddings themselves.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Token Embeddings**: First, you obtain the token embeddings for your sequence just like you normally would.

2. **Zero Positional Encoding**: Instead of adding the usual positional encodings to the token embeddings, you add zeros of the same shape. This means that the positional information is effectively set to a neutral state.

3. **Forward Pass**: You then perform a forward pass through the model using this "position-less" input. The resulting hidden states should, in theory, be free from the influence of positional encoding.

4. **Analysis**: You can now use these "position-less" hidden states for your UMAP visualization or any other analysis you're interested in.

5. **Caveats**: Keep in mind that by doing this, you're essentially using the model in a way it was not trained for. The absence of positional information could lead to hidden states that are difficult to interpret or lack meaningful structure, as the model relies on position for understanding sequence relationships.

This approach is more of a "what-if" analysis to understand how the latent states might look without the influence of positional encoding. It's not an "undoing" of the effect, but rather an exploration of how the model behaves without that specific information. Would you like to proceed with a code example to illustrate this?

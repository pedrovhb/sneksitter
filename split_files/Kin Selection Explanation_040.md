Hypothetically speaking, if a coral were placed in a microwave, it would likely die within a very short period, possibly within seconds to a minute, depending on the microwave's power and the size and type of the coral. The microwave radiation would cause rapid heating of the water within the coral's cells, leading to cellular breakdown and death.

The symbiotic algae living within the coral, known as zooxanthellae, would also be killed quickly. Additionally, any toxins or chemicals within the coral could be released, posing a risk of contamination.

Remember, this is a hypothetical scenario, and such an action would be both unethical and potentially illegal. The actual time could vary based on various factors, but the outcome would be fatal for the coral.

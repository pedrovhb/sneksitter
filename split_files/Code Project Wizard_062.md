### Contextual Analysis

#### Example 1: FileWizard (CLI Tool)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A CLI tool for file manipulations using Python and the Click library.
- **Gap Identification**: The spec lacks details on what specific file manipulations are supported. Sub-commands, options, and arguments are not specified.

    - Questions:
        1. What specific file operations will FileWizard support (e.g., copy, move, delete)?
        2. What command-line options or arguments are needed for these operations?

#### Example 2: MathMaster (Library)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A Python library for mathematical operations with a Matrix class that supports addition and multiplication.
- **Gap Identification**: The library focuses on basic arithmetic and matrix operations but lacks utility functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc.

    - Questions:
        1. Are utility functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc., within the scope of this library?
        2. Will the Matrix class support operations like determinant calculation or inversion?

#### Example 3: TextGuru (Library)

- **Semantic Understanding**: A Python library for text processing, providing functions for substring search and replacement, case conversion.
- **Gap Identification**: The library does not mention support for text encoding/decoding or regular expressions.

    - Questions:
        1. Will TextGuru support text encoding and decoding?
        2. Is regular expression support planned for advanced text manipulation?

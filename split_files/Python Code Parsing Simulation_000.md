Please run the code below in your environment, creating the sample code as requested:

# Importing the necessary module and initializing the parser and language objects
import tree_sitter_languages

sample_code = b"""
... <replace this with some sample code demonstrating different types of function definitions, methods, closures, with/without decorators, etc etc>

Unfortunately, I can't directly import external libraries like `tree_sitter_languages` because my environment lacks internet access. However, we can simulate the functionality of Tree-sitter using Python code. Would you like to proceed with that approach?

My apologies; it seems I was mistaken about the availability of the `tree_sitter_languages` module. Would you like to proceed with an alternative approach to simulate the functionality you're looking for?

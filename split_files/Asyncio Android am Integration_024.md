# Assistant

Listing available activities and their parameters on Android usually requires access to the device or emulator running Android. The typical ways to find a list of activities and their parameters include:

1. **Dumping System Information**: Using the `dumpsys` command can provide extensive information about system services, including activities. For example, `dumpsys activity activities` gives detailed information about current activities.

2. **Reading APK Manifest**: You can use tools like `aapt` to dump the manifest file of an APK, which contains information about available activities and their parameters. Command: `aapt dump xmltree <path_to_apk> AndroidManifest.xml`.

3. **Use `pm` Commands**: The `pm` (package manager) command-line tool can list all installed packages, which you can then use to look up their manifests for activity information. For example, `pm list packages` lists installed packages, and `pm dump <package_name>` provides more details, including activities.

4. **Third-Party Tools**: Tools like `Drozer` or specialized apps can provide a UI for exploring activities and other components.

5. **Programmatic Query**: Android apps can query the `PackageManager` to get a list of installed activities. This is more applicable if you're writing an Android app to discover activities.

6. **Online Resources**: Sometimes, apps or SDKs provide documentation that lists their activities and how to invoke them using intents.

7. **Reverse Engineering**: In some cases, reverse engineering is applied to understand the available activities and parameters, although this may be against the app's terms of service.

If you're interested in doing this programmatically, you'd typically do it on-device or via a connected device through ADB, rather than purely through the `am` command-line utility.

Would you like to explore any of these methods in more detail?

### External Tokens

Tree-sitter allows you to define tokens in external scanner code (usually in C). This is often used for parsing constructs that can't be easily described using CFGs, like string interpolation.

```json
{
  "externals": [
    {"type": "named", "name": "interpolated_string"}
  ]
}
```

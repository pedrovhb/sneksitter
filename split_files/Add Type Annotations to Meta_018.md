### Alternative Approaches:

1. **Class Decorator**: Instead of using a metaclass, a class decorator could be used to wrap the `__new__` or `__init__` methods for the Flyweight pattern. However, metaclasses offer the benefit of being more explicit in their intent.

2. **Instance-level Pooling**: The Flyweight pattern could also be implemented at the instance level, inside the `__new__` method of the class itself, rather than using a metaclass. This could be a bit more straightforward but lacks the reusability of a metaclass.

3. **Strong Reference Dictionary**: The `WeakValueDictionary` is useful for garbage collection, but if you need the instances to persist, a standard dictionary could be used.

Would you like to see code examples for any of these points?

Certainly, Futures can be considered the foundational building block for asyncio-based asynchronous programming. They encapsulate the result of an operation that may not have completed yet, providing a way to wait for the result and to set callbacks for further actions.

### Futures
1. **Basic Usage**
    - Creating a Future
    - Setting and Getting the Result
    - Setting an Exception
    - Checking Future Status
  
2. **Advanced Usage**
    - Callbacks
    - Chaining Futures
  
3. **Common Use-Cases**
  
4. **Under the Hood**

Let's start with the basic usage of Futures.

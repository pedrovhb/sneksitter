Managing excitement and distraction in a high-energy breed like the German Shorthaired Pointer can be challenging. Here are some targeted strategies you can try:

### Desensitization:

1. **Controlled Encounters**: Set up scenarios where she encounters distractions in a controlled setting. Start at a distance where she notices but isn't overly excited.

2. **Clicker Training**: Use a clicker or a marker word when she looks at you instead of the distraction, followed by a reward.

3. **Decrease Distance**: Gradually close the distance between the distraction and your dog, continuing to reward focus on you.

### Impulse Control:

1. **"Leave It" Command**: Teach a strong "leave it" command and practice it with increasing levels of difficulty.

2. **"Stay" or "Wait"**: Use these commands to make her pause and look to you for guidance, even in exciting situations.

3. **Premack Principle**: Use the opportunity to go towards the distraction as a reward for first performing a behavior you want. For example, she must sit before she gets to greet a person.

### Mental Stimulation:

1. **Obedience Training**: Regular, short sessions can help tire her mentally.
  
2. **Interactive Toys**: Use puzzle toys that make her work for her food.

3. **Tracking and Sniffing Games**: Utilize her natural instincts to give her a job to do.

### Physical Exercise:

1. **Adequate Exercise**: Make sure she's well-exercised before expecting her to be calm. A tired dog is generally less reactive.

2. **High-Intensity Games**: Activities like fetch, tug-of-war, or agility can help burn off some of that excess energy.

### General Tips:

1. **Consistency**: Make sure all family members are consistent with commands and rewards.

2. **Positive Reinforcement**: Always reward calm behavior, even when there aren't distractions.

3. **Professional Help**: If issues persist, consider consulting a dog behaviorist or a certified professional dog trainer.

Training for this kind of issue is often incremental and may take time to see significant improvement. It's crucial to be patient and consistent throughout the training process.

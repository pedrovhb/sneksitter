### Introduction

Cython is often considered a superset of Python that allows static typing and direct invocation of C/C++ routines. While Python is designed to be simple and easy to read, Cython introduces additional syntax and constructs primarily focused on performance and seamless integration with C/C++. This chapter aims to bring Python experts up to speed on the unique aspects of Cython's syntax and its implications.

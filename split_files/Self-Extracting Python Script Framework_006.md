Let's design a Python framework for creating self-extracting scripts. The output will be a Python file with the necessary code which, when imported or run, automagically installs libraries, moves files to certain locations, and optionally performs other arbitrary operations. The data will be contained within a tar.gz base64-encoded string hardcoded into the resulting script. We're aiming for a flexible design, so individual operations (e.g. installing libraries, moving files) should be implemented as subclasses extending a given ABC interface. Before starting code, let's explore the problem and approaches in 800 words, gradually settling on a spec after iterating over possible approaches for each sub-task.

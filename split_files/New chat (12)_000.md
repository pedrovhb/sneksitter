To get keyframes every \( N \) seconds from a video given a URL, without downloading the full video, you can use FFmpeg's `-ss` and `-frames:v` options in conjunction with `-vf "select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I)"` to extract keyframes. The `-ss` option seeks to a given time in the input, and `-frames:v` specifies the number of video frames to output. The `-vf "select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I)"` filter ensures that only keyframes (I-frames) are selected.

Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Probe the video to get its duration and other metadata.
2. Calculate the timestamps where keyframes should be extracted.
3. Run FFmpeg commands to extract keyframes at those timestamps.

### Step 1: Probe Video for Duration

If you're looking to get keyframes every \( N \) seconds from a video URL without downloading the full video in a single command, you can use FFmpeg with a combination of its options. Specifically, the `-ss` option to specify the starting point, the `-vf "select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I)"` filter to select keyframes, and the `-an` option to skip audio can be useful.

Here's a generic FFmpeg command that would do this:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss [start_time] -i [URL] -vf "select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I)" -vsync vfr -an -r 1/[N] keyframe_%03d.png
```

- `[start_time]`: Time to start the video. Usually set this to 0 to start at the beginning.
- `[URL]`: The video URL.
- `[N]`: Number of seconds between each keyframe you want to extract.

To get keyframes every 5 seconds from a video starting at the beginning, you can modify the command as follows:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 0 -i [URL] -vf "select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I)" -vsync vfr -an -r 1/5 keyframe_%03d.png
```

**Note**: Replace `[URL]` with the actual video URL.

This command works by decoding the video stream but only keeping keyframes, which are then output at a rate of one every \( N \) seconds. 

Keep in mind that this method still requires FFmpeg to process the video, so the video data will be streamed, but not stored in its entirety. Would you like to proceed with this approach in Python using `asyncio` for subprocess handling?

Can we have it stream only the parts necessary? Doesn't need to be precisely keyframes, can be just a frame every minute, for instance

Certainly, you can fetch only specific segments of a video by using the `-ss` and `-t` options multiple times in FFmpeg to skip directly to the parts of the video you're interested in. This avoids having to stream the entire video. However, this approach would require you to run multiple FFmpeg instances in parallel for each time segment you're interested in, because each instance would only download and process a small part of the video.

To extract one frame (not necessarily a keyframe) every \( N \) seconds, you can use the following FFmpeg command as a template:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss [start_time] -t [duration] -i [URL] -vf "fps=1/[N]" -an frame_%03d.png
```

- `[start_time]`: The time to start in the video.
- `[duration]`: The duration to capture from the `[start_time]`.
- `[URL]`: The video URL.
- `[N]`: Extract one frame every \( N \) seconds.

To fetch only specific segments, you'd run multiple instances of this command with different `[start_time]` and `[duration]` parameters.

In Python, you can use `asyncio` to run these FFmpeg instances asynchronously. Would you like to proceed with implementing this?

How do I use ffmpeg to get a frame or a say 5 second clip of a URL video every N seconds given a URL, without having to stream the full video?

## Approach

To extract a frame or a short clip from a URL video every \( N \) seconds without streaming the entire video, we can use `ffmpeg` with HTTP-based protocols that allow partial content fetching. These protocols include HTTP pseudo-streaming and HLS (HTTP Live Streaming).

### Partial Content Fetching with HTTP Range Requests

For HTTP pseudo-streaming, you can use HTTP range requests with `ffmpeg`. These range requests allow you to download only a part of the video, specified by the byte range. This is often used for streaming media.

### Using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

HLS splits video content into small parts, and you can download individual segments. `ffmpeg` supports HLS natively, so you can specify which segments to download.

Here's how to do it:

### Commands

#### Frame Extraction

To extract a single frame at a specific time \( t \) from a URL:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss [start_seconds] -i [URL] -frames:v 1 [output_image]
```

#### 5-Second Clip

To extract a 5-second video clip starting at \( t \):

```bash
ffmpeg -ss [start_seconds] -i [URL] -t 5 [output_video]
```

### Python Code to Automate the Task

Here's how you can automate this task using Python and `asyncio`.

First, install the required packages if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install aiofiles aiohttp
```

Now, let's write the code:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import aiofiles
import os
from pathlib import Path

async def download_segment(url: str, start_time: int, duration: int, output_path: Path):
    command = [
        "ffmpeg",
        "-ss", str(start_time),  # Start time in seconds
        "-i", url,               # Input URL
        "-t", str(duration),     # Duration in seconds
        "-y",                    # Overwrite output files without asking
        str(output_path)         # Output path
    ]
    proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(*command)
    await proc.communicate()

async def main():
    url = "your_video_url_here"
    output_dir = Path("./clips")
    output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Download a 5-second clip every 60 seconds
    for i in range(0, 600, 60):
        output_path = output_dir / f"clip_{i}.mp4"
        await download_segment(url, i, 5, output_path)

# Run the event loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Replace `your_video_url_here` with the video URL you're interested in.

This code will download a 5-second clip every 60 seconds up to the 600th second of the video. It saves the clips to a folder named `clips`.

Note: This example assumes that the server supports range requests or HLS segmentation. If the server doesn't, you'll have to download the entire video first, which you want to avoid.

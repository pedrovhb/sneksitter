Your list is comprehensive and covers a wide range of design patterns across different categories. Here are some observations:

### Creational Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: This is often considered more of a technique than a formal design pattern. However, it's widely used, so its inclusion makes sense.
- **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)**: This is more often associated with languages like C++ that do not have garbage collection. Nevertheless, it is a crucial concept for resource management.

### Structural Patterns
- **Extension Object**: This is less commonly discussed but is a useful pattern for extending classes without modifying them.
- **Delegation**: Similar to Dependency Injection, some might argue that it's more of a technique than a formal pattern, but it's widely used for the same reasons.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Blackboard**: This is less commonly found in typical application development and more in specialized fields like AI, but it's a valid design pattern.
- **Fluent Interface**: This is a technique for making object-oriented APIs more readable and easy to use but is often categorized as a design pattern for its utility.
  
### Concurrency Patterns
- **Safe Concurrency with Exclusive Ownership**: This is a pattern that's becoming more relevant with the focus on data-race-free concurrency models in languages like Rust.
- **CPU atomic operation**: This is more of a low-level mechanism than a design pattern. However, it forms the basis for implementing many higher-level concurrency patterns.
  
Your list is quite extensive and includes both classical design patterns as well as some that are more specialized or language-specific. Overall, it provides a good overview of design patterns used in various aspects of software engineering.

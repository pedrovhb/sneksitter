To clean up control characters in a file that could cause a `yaml.reader.ReaderError`, you can use Python's `re` module to remove or replace those characters. Specifically, you can use `re.sub` with a regex pattern to match control characters and replace them with an empty string or some other placeholder.

Here's a regex pattern that should match most control characters:

```regex
[\x00-\x1F\x80-\x9F]
```

The above regex pattern includes:

- `\x00-\x1F`: ASCII control characters (0-31)
- `\x80-\x9F`: Additional control characters in the extended ASCII range

Here's how to use it with `re.sub`:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path

def clean_control_chars(file_path: Path):
    with file_path.open('r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Remove control characters
    cleaned_content = re.sub(r'[\x00-\x1F\x80-\x9F]', '', content)

    # Write the cleaned content back to the file
    with file_path.open('w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(cleaned_content)

# Usage example
file_path = Path("your_file.yaml")
clean_control_chars(file_path)
```

This function reads a file, removes the control characters, and then writes the cleaned content back to the same file. You might want to backup your file before running this operation.

What would we need to keep in mind when designing a library for Python code generation with Python from template libraries such as mako? I'm thinking a data model for code components powered by Pydantic, where each component knows how to render itself (possibly kind of recursively, calling from its fields which may contain instances of components themselves). They're be composed so a Class has its info including decorators bases, etc

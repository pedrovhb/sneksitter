Several issues can be observed in the given code:

1. **Type Annotations for `bases` and `members`:** The `bases` and `members` are expected to be a list of strings (`list[str]`). While this is fine if you always expect a list, it may be more Pythonic to use `Sequence[str]` if an immutable sequence like a tuple could also be valid.

2. **Indentation in the Generated Class:** The use of `map(str.strip, body.splitlines())` may inadvertently remove indentation that is supposed to be part of the class body, especially if `members` include indented blocks of code.

3. **Usage of `d()`:** There's a call to a function `d()`, which is not defined anywhere in the code. It's unclear what this function is supposed to do.

4. **String Formatting:** The f-string used for formatting the entire class is a bit hard to read due to the multiline string and indents. This might make it a bit difficult to debug and maintain.

5. **Optional Bases and Members:** If `bases` or `members` are `None`, the `join` method will throw a `TypeError`.

Here's a refactored version of the code addressing these issues:

```python
from typing import Sequence, Optional

def gen_class(
    cls_name: str,
    docstring: Optional[str] = None,
    bases: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
    members: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
) -> str:
    bases_str = f"({', '.join(bases)})" if bases else ""
    members_str = "\n".join(members) if members else ""
    docstring_str = f'"""{docstring}"""' if docstring else ""
    
    body_parts = [part for part in [docstring_str, members_str] if part]
    body = "\n".join(body_parts) if body_parts else "pass"

    # Add indentation
    indented_body = "\n    ".join(body.split("\n"))

    return (
        f"class {cls_name}{bases_str}:\n    "
        f"{indented_body}"
    ).strip()
```

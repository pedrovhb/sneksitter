In a purely hypothetical context, the effect of a microwave on different types of animals would depend on several factors:

1. **Size of the Animal**: Larger animals have more mass and would take longer to heat throughout, but the heating would be extremely uneven.
  
2. **Water Content**: Animals with higher water content would heat more quickly due to the microwave's effect on water molecules.

3. **Density**: More densely packed tissues might heat differently compared to less dense tissues.

4. **Microwave Power**: Higher wattage microwaves would heat the animal more quickly.

5. **Presence of Metal**: Some animals, like certain types of fish, ingest small pebbles or have metal-based molecules in their bodies. Metal can spark in a microwave, causing fires.

In any case, the result would likely be immediate and extreme suffering for the animal, followed by death. The cells would be rapidly destroyed, and internal organs would be damaged or fail.

It's crucial to stress that this is purely a hypothetical discussion. Microwaving living animals is unethical, cruel, and likely illegal.

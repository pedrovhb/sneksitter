### On the Android Device:

1. **Revoke USB Debugging Authorizations**: You mentioned you've tried this, but it's always good to double-check. This is generally under `Settings > Developer options > Revoke USB debugging authorizations`.

2. **USB Configuration**: Set the USB mode to `MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)` or `PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol)` and then back to `Charging` to trigger the authorization dialog.

3. **Check for Hidden Dialogs**: Sometimes the dialog is hiding behind other windows, so make sure youâ€™ve checked the device thoroughly.

4. **Cable and Port**: Try a different USB cable and/or port.

5. **ADB over Wi-Fi**: As a last resort, you can try connecting via Wi-Fi to see if the problem persists.

### SymPy

1. **Symbolic Computing**: Unlike other computational libraries, SymPy performs exact arithmetic, enabling precise manipulation of mathematical expressions.

2. **Calculus**: You can perform symbolic differentiation, integration, and limit calculations. This is very useful for understanding the behavior of mathematical functions.

3. **Equation Solving**: Solves equations symbolically, not just numerically. This includes algebraic equations, differential equations, and systems of equations.

4. **Matrix Operations**: SymPy can handle matrix symbolic expressions, which is useful for linear algebra problems and transformations.

5. **Code Generation**: You can generate executable code (C, Python, JavaScript, etc.) from symbolic expressions, making it easier to transition from symbolic to numerical simulations.

6. **Physics Engine**: SymPy includes modules for classical mechanics, optics, and quantum mechanics.

7. **Pretty Printing**: Provides LaTeX, ASCII, and Unicode representations of equations, making them easier to interpret and present.

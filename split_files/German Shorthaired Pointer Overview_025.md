Having your dog perform commands like "sit," "paw," and "lie down" during a walk isn't inherently a bad idea. In fact, it can be a good way to incorporate obedience training into daily activities. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on a few factors:

1. **Timing**: If the dog is overly excited or stimulated, she may find it difficult to focus on commands. The beginning of a walk might not be the best time to practice these skills.

2. **Context**: Understand that a walk is a highly stimulating environment for a dog, especially for a breed like the German Shorthaired Pointer that has strong hunting and tracking instincts.

3. **Frustration**: As you've noticed, the dog becomes whiny or moany, which could indicate frustration or confusion. This could potentially lead to more problematic behaviors if not addressed.

4. **Counterproductive**: If not done carefully, stopping frequently for commands could make walks less enjoyable for the dog and less effective as a form of exercise and mental stimulation.

If your primary goal is to enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted walk, then continuously stopping for obedience training could be counterproductive. On the other hand, if obedience training during walks aligns with your overall training goals and you're able to manage the dog's frustration, then it can be a useful technique. 

So, it's not a bad idea per se, but it does require a thoughtful approach to be effective.

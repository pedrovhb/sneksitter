To implement the `merge` functionality, you'd want to consume items from multiple `AsyncStream` objects concurrently and yield items from any of the input streams as they arrive. Here's how you could add a `merge` class method to your `AsyncStream` class:

```python
from typing import List

class AsyncStream(Generic[_T_co], AsyncIterable[_T_co]):
    # ... existing code ...

    @classmethod
    async def merge(cls, streams: List[AsyncStream[_T_co]]) -> AsyncStream[_T_co]:
        out_queue: asyncio.Queue[_T_co] = asyncio.Queue()

        async def _forward_to_output(stream: AsyncStream[_T_co]) -> None:
            async for item in stream:
                await out_queue.put(item)

        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(_forward_to_output(stream)) for stream in streams]

        async def _merged_stream() -> AsyncIterator[_T_co]:
            pending_tasks = set(tasks)
            while pending_tasks:
                done, pending_tasks = await asyncio.wait(
                    pending_tasks, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED
                )
                for task in done:
                    if task.exception():
                        continue  # or propagate the exception, based on your requirements

                try:
                    while True:
                        yield out_queue.get_nowait()
                except asyncio.QueueEmpty:
                    pass

        return cls(_merged_stream())
```

In this implementation, we're using an `asyncio.Queue` to act as the merged output stream. Each input stream gets its own coroutine (`_forward_to_output`) that forwards its items to this output queue. The `merge` method returns a new `AsyncStream` that reads from this queue.

Here's a quick example demonstrating how to use `merge`:

```python
async def main() -> None:
    stream1 = AsyncStream(arange(0, 10, 2, delay=100))
    stream2 = AsyncStream(arange(1, 10, 2, delay=150))

    merged_stream = await AsyncStream.merge([stream1, stream2])

    async for item in merged_stream:
        print(item)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This will print numbers from 0 to 9 in an approximately sorted order, depending on the delays in `arange`. Feel free to integrate this into your existing class.

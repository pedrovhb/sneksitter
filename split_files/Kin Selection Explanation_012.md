Certainly, here are some classic examples where kin selection is observed:

### Social Insects

- **Honeybees**: Worker bees are sterile females that protect the hive and gather resources. They will even perform a suicidal "stinging attack" on intruders to protect the queen and hive.
  
- **Ant Colonies**: Similar to bees, ant colonies often consist of sterile workers that forage, build, and defend the nest. Soldier ants may sacrifice themselves in defense of the colony.

### Mammals

- **Meerkats**: As mentioned earlier, some meerkats act as sentinels, standing guard and alerting the group to predators, thereby risking their own safety.
  
- **Belding's Ground Squirrels**: These squirrels give alarm calls to warn relatives of approaching predators. The one giving the call is more exposed, but the call benefits close kin.

### Birds

- **Florida Scrub-Jays**: These birds are known to help their parents raise younger siblings, delaying their own reproduction but ensuring the survival of kin.

### Humans

- **Altruism and Family**: Humans are often more willing to help close family members than strangers, which can be explained through kin selection. This is even reflected in legal systems, where inheritance typically passes to closest relatives.

Each of these examples demonstrates different facets of kin selection, from self-sacrifice to cooperative behaviors that benefit close relatives. Would you like more information on any of these?

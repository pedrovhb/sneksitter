### Specifications

1. **Data Packing**:
    - Use `tarfile` and `base64` to pack files and directories.
    - Include an option for compression levels.

2. **Data Unpacking**:
    - Use `tarfile` and `base64` for unpacking.
    - Perform unpacking in a temp directory or a user-specified directory.
    - Include error-handling mechanisms.

3. **Operation Interfaces**:
    - Create an ABC named `Operation` with methods like `execute()`, `validate()`, etc.
    - Subclasses like `InstallLibraries`, `MoveFiles`, and `ExecuteCode` will implement the `Operation` interface.

4. **Script Generation**:
    - Generate Python code dynamically.
    - Include the base64-encoded tar.gz string in the generated code.
    - Include code for each operation, using their respective `execute()` methods.

By adhering to these specifications, we can create a Python framework that is both robust and extensible, allowing for a wide range of self-extracting script use-cases.

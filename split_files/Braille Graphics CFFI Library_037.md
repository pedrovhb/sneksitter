Great! With our brainstorming session complete, we have several pathways we can explore. The next steps would typically involve:

1. Drafting algorithms for coordinate translation and bit manipulation for braille characters.
2. Identifying efficient data structures for the 2D grid in both Python and C.
3. Drafting the C code focusing on performance, including testing out some of the more advanced optimization techniques we discussed.

Would you like to start with algorithm drafting or jump straight into coding prototypes? We could also start by sketching out some of the core logic in pseudocode if that would be helpful.

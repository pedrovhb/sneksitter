#### The Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: Parse the Tree-sitter grammar files to extract rules and relations between them.
2. **Graph Construction**: Use NetworkX to construct the graph in-memory. Each node would represent a grammar rule, and edges would represent relationships between rules.
3. **Graph Analysis**: Apply graph algorithms to identify key nodes (central grammar rules), communities (sets of closely related rules), or even bottlenecks (rules that make parsing inefficient).
4. **Visualization with Graphviz**: Export the NetworkX graph to DOT format and utilize Graphviz for rendering. Customize node and edge attributes for better interpretability.

### What Are Synchronous Iterators?

Synchronous iterators are the cornerstone of iterable objects in Python. They allow you to traverse over elements in a collection, typically in a sequential and blocking manner. In other words, when you're iterating over elements, the operation is done one at a time, and the program waits for the operation to complete before moving on to the next task.

```python
# Simple example of synchronous iteration
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(i)
```

This is fine for CPU-bound or low-latency IO-bound tasks where waiting is not detrimental to performance. However, it's important to understand that this "waiting" is what differentiates synchronous iterators from their asynchronous counterparts.

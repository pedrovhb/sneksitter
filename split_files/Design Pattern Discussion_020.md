### Concurrency Patterns
- **Fork-Join**: Divide a parallelizable problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them in parallel, and then combine the results.
- **Future and Promise**: Represents a value that will be available in the future, typically used for asynchronous operations.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Provides stability and prevents cascading failures in distributed systems.
  
These are additional patterns or variations that are commonly seen in different aspects of software engineering. Adding these to your list would make it even more complete.

Many code analysis tasks involve searching for patterns in syntax trees. Tree-sitter provides a small declarative language for expressing these patterns and searching for matches. The language is similar to the format of Tree-sitter’s unit test system.
Query Syntax

A query consists of one or more patterns, where each pattern is an S-expression that matches a certain set of nodes in a syntax tree. The expression to match a given node consists of a pair of parentheses containing two things: the node’s type, and optionally, a series of other S-expressions that match the node’s children. For example, this pattern would match any binary_expression node whose children are both number_literal nodes:

(binary_expression (number_literal) (number_literal))

Children can also be omitted. For example, this would match any binary_expression where at least one of child is a string_literal node:

(binary_expression (string_literal))

Fields

In general, it’s a good idea to make patterns more specific by specifying field names associated with child nodes. You do this by prefixing a child pattern with a field name followed by a colon. For example, this pattern would match an assignment_expression node where the left child is a member_expression whose object is a call_expression.

(assignment_expression
  left: (member_expression
    object: (call_expression)))

Negated Fields

You can also constrain a pattern so that it only matches nodes that lack a certain field. To do this, add a field name prefixed by a ! within the parent pattern. For example, this pattern would match a class declaration with no type parameters:

(class_declaration
  name: (identifier) @class_name
  !type_parameters)

Anonymous Nodes

The parenthesized syntax for writing nodes only applies to named nodes. To match specific anonymous nodes, you write their name between double quotes. For example, this pattern would match any binary_expression where the operator is != and the right side is null:

(binary_expression
  operator: "!="
  right: (null))

Capturing Nodes

When matching patterns, you may want to process specific nodes within the pattern. Captures allow you to associate names with specific nodes in a pattern, so that you can later refer to those nodes by those names. Capture names are written after the nodes that they refer to, and start with an @ character.

For example, this pattern would match any assignment of a function to an identifier, and it would associate the name the-function-name with the identifier:

(assignment_expression
  left: (identifier) @the-function-name
  right: (function))

And this pattern would match all method definitions, associating the name the-method-name with the method name, the-class-name with the containing class name:

(class_declaration
  name: (identifier) @the-class-name
  body: (class_body
    (method_definition
      name: (property_identifier) @the-method-name)))

Quantification Operators

You can match a repeating sequence of sibling nodes using the postfix + and * repetition operators, which work analogously to the + and * operators in regular expressions. The + operator matches one or more repetitions of a pattern, and the * operator matches zero or more.

For example, this pattern would match a sequence of one or more comments:

(comment)+

This pattern would match a class declaration, capturing all of the decorators if any were present:

(class_declaration
  (decorator)* @the-decorator
  name: (identifier) @the-name)

You can also mark a node as optional using the ? operator. For example, this pattern would match all function calls, capturing a string argument if one was present:

(call_expression
  function: (identifier) @the-function
  arguments: (arguments (string)? @the-string-arg))

Grouping Sibling Nodes

You can also use parentheses for grouping a sequence of sibling nodes. For example, this pattern would match a comment followed by a function declaration:

(
  (comment)
  (function_declaration)
)

Any of the quantification operators mentioned above (+, *, and ?) can also be applied to groups. For example, this pattern would match a comma-separated series of numbers:

(
  (number)
  ("," (number))*
)

Alternations

An alternation is written as a pair of square brackets ([]) containing a list of alternative patterns. This is similar to character classes from regular expressions ([abc] matches either a, b, or c).

For example, this pattern would match a call to either a variable or an object property. In the case of a variable, capture it as @function, and in the case of a property, capture it as @method:

(call_expression
  function: [
    (identifier) @function
    (member_expression
      property: (property_identifier) @method)
  ])

This pattern would match a set of possible keyword tokens, capturing them as @keyword:

[
  "break"
  "delete"
  "else"
  "for"
  "function"
  "if"
  "return"
  "try"
  "while"
] @keyword

Wildcard Node

A wildcard node is represented with an underscore (_), it matches any node. This is similar to . in regular expressions. There are two types, (_) will match any named node, and _ will match any named or anonymous node.

For example, this pattern would match any node inside a call:

(call (_) @call.inner)

Anchors

The anchor operator, ., is used to constrain the ways in which child patterns are matched. It has different behaviors depending on where it’s placed inside a query.

When . is placed before the first child within a parent pattern, the child will only match when it is the first named node in the parent. For example, the below pattern matches a given array node at most once, assigning the @the-element capture to the first identifier node in the parent array:

(array . (identifier) @the-element)

Without this anchor, the pattern would match once for every identifier in the array, with @the-element bound to each matched identifier.

Similarly, an anchor placed after a pattern’s last child will cause that child pattern to only match nodes that are the last named child of their parent. The below pattern matches only nodes that are the last named child within a block.

(block (_) @last-expression .)

Finally, an anchor between two child patterns will cause the patterns to only match nodes that are immediate siblings. The pattern below, given a long dotted name like a.b.c.d, will only match pairs of consecutive identifiers: a, b, b, c, and c, d.

(dotted_name
  (identifier) @prev-id
  .
  (identifier) @next-id)

Without the anchor, non-consecutive pairs like a, c and b, d would also be matched.

The restrictions placed on a pattern by an anchor operator ignore anonymous nodes.
Predicates

You can also specify arbitrary metadata and conditions associated with a pattern by adding predicate S-expressions anywhere within your pattern. Predicate S-expressions start with a predicate name beginning with a # character. After that, they can contain an arbitrary number of @-prefixed capture names or strings.

Tree-Sitter’s CLI supports the following predicates by default:
eq?, not-eq?, any-eq?, any-not-eq?

This family of predicates allows you to match against a single capture or string value.

The first argument must be a capture, but the second can be either a capture to compare the two captures’ text, or a string to compare first capture’s text against.

The base predicate is “#eq?”, but its complement “#not-eq?” can be used to not match a value.

Consider the following example targeting C:

((identifier) @variable.builtin
  (#eq? @variable.builtin "self"))

This pattern would match any identifier that is self or this.

And this pattern would match key-value pairs where the value is an identifier with the same name as the key:

(
  (pair
    key: (property_identifier) @key-name
    value: (identifier) @value-name)
  (#eq? @key-name @value-name)
)

The prefix “any-“ is meant for use with quantified captures. Here’s an example finding a segment of empty comments

((comment)+ @comment.empty
  (#any-eq? @comment.empty "//"))

Note that “#any-eq?” will match a quantified capture if any of the nodes match the predicate, while by default a quantified capture will only match if all the nodes match the predicate.
match?, not-match?, any-match?, any-not-match?

These predicates are similar to the eq? predicates, but they use regular expressions to match against the capture’s text.

The first argument must be a capture, and the second must be a string containing a regular expression.

For example, this pattern would match identifier whose name is written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:

((identifier) @constant
  (#match? @constant "^[A-Z][A-Z_]+"))

Here’s an example finding potential documentation comments in C

((comment)+ @comment.documentation
  (#match? @comment.documentation "^///\s+.*"))

Here’s another example finding Cgo comments to potentially inject with C

((comment)+ @injection.content
  .
  (import_declaration
    (import_spec path: (interpreted_string_literal) @_import_c))
  (#eq? @_import_c "\"C\"")
  (#match? @injection.content "^//"))

any-of?, not-any-of?

The “any-of?” predicate allows you to match a capture against multiple strings, and will match if the capture’s text is equal to any of the strings.

Consider this example that targets JavaScript:

((identifier) @variable.builtin
  (#any-of? @variable.builtin
        "arguments"
        "module"
        "console"
        "window"
        "document"))

This will match any of the builtin variables in JavaScript.

Note — Predicates are not handled directly by the Tree-sitter C library. They are just exposed in a structured form so that higher-level code can perform the filtering. However, higher-level bindings to Tree-sitter like the Rust Crate or the WebAssembly binding do implement a few common predicates like the #eq?, #match?, and #any-of? predicates explained above.

To recap about the predicates Tree-Sitter’s bindings support:

    #eq? checks for a direct match against a capture or string
    #match? checks for a match against a regular expression
    #any-of? checks for a match against a list of strings
    Adding not- to the beginning of any of these predicates will negate the match
    By default, a quantified capture will only match if all of the nodes match the predicate
    Adding any- before the eq or match predicates will instead match if any of the nodes match the predicate

Tagging is the act of identifying the entities that can be named in a program. We use Tree-sitter queries to find those entities. Having found them, you use a syntax capture to label the entity and its name.

The essence of a given tag lies in two pieces of data: the role of the entity that is matched (i.e. whether it is a definition or a reference) and the kind of that entity, which describes how the entity is used (i.e. whether it’s a class definition, function call, variable reference, and so on). Our convention is to use a syntax capture following the @role.kind capture name format, and another inner capture, always called @name, that pulls out the name of a given identifier.

You may optionally include a capture named @doc to bind a docstring. For convenience purposes, the tagging system provides two built-in functions, #select-adjacent! and #strip! that are convenient for removing comment syntax from a docstring. #strip! takes a capture as its first argument and a regular expression as its second, expressed as a quoted string. Any text patterns matched by the regular expression will be removed from the text associated with the passed capture. #select-adjacent!, when passed two capture names, filters the text associated with the first capture so that only nodes adjacent to the second capture are preserved. This can be useful when writing queries that would otherwise include too much information in matched comments.
Examples

This query recognizes Python function definitions and captures their declared name. The function_definition syntax node is defined in the Python Tree-sitter grammar.

(function_definition
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.function

A more sophisticated query can be found in the JavaScript Tree-sitter repository:

(assignment_expression
  left: [
    (identifier) @name
    (member_expression
      property: (property_identifier) @name)
  ]
  right: [(arrow_function) (function)]
) @definition.function

An even more sophisticated query is in the Ruby Tree-sitter repository, which uses built-in functions to strip the Ruby comment character (#) from the docstrings associated with a class or singleton-class declaration, then selects only the docstrings adjacent to the node matched as @definition.class.

(
  (comment)* @doc
  .
  [
    (class
      name: [
        (constant) @name
        (scope_resolution
          name: (_) @name)
      ]) @definition.class
    (singleton_class
      value: [
        (constant) @name
        (scope_resolution
          name: (_) @name)
      ]) @definition.class
  ]
  (#strip! @doc "^#\\s*")
  (#select-adjacent! @doc @definition.class)
)

The below table describes a standard vocabulary for kinds and roles during the tagging process. New applications may extend (or only recognize a subset of) these capture names, but it is desirable to standardize on the names below.
Category 	Tag
Class definitions 	@definition.class
Function definitions 	@definition.function
Interface definitions 	@definition.interface
Method definitions 	@definition.method
Module definitions 	@definition.module
Function/method calls 	@reference.call
Class reference 	@reference.class
Interface implementation 	@reference.implementation

# Assistant

Certainly. In Tree-sitter, you can use queries to capture nodes of interest in the syntax tree. Here's a Tree-sitter query that should capture Python function definitions, along with their decorators if present:

```scheme
; Capture function definition and its name
(function_definition
  name: (identifier) @function.name) @function.definition

; Capture decorators if present
(
  (decorator)+
  .
  (function_definition)
) @function.with-decorators

; Optionally, capture the individual decorators
(decorator
  name: [
    (dotted_name (identifier) @decorator.name)
    (call_expression
      function: (dotted_name (identifier) @decorator.name)
    )
  ]
) @decorator
```

In this query:

- `@function.definition` captures the function definition.
- `@function.name` captures the function's name.
- `@function.with-decorators` captures function definitions that have one or more decorators.
- `@decorator` captures individual decorators.
- `@decorator.name` captures the name of each decorator.

The query uses Tree-sitter's S-expression-based query language, making it relatively straightforward to specify complex patterns in the syntax tree. Would you like more details on any specific part?

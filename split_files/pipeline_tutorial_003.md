## Parameters

[`pipeline`] supports many parameters; some are task specific, and some are general to all pipelines.
In general, you can specify parameters anywhere you want:

```py
transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", my_parameter=1)

out = transcriber(...)  # This will use `my_parameter=1`.
out = transcriber(..., my_parameter=2)  # This will override and use `my_parameter=2`.
out = transcriber(...)  # This will go back to using `my_parameter=1`.
```

Let's check out 3 important ones:

### Device

If you use `device=n`, the pipeline automatically puts the model on the specified device.
This will work regardless of whether you are using PyTorch or Tensorflow.

```py
transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", device=0)
```

If the model is too large for a single GPU and you are using PyTorch, you can set `device_map="auto"` to automatically 
determine how to load and store the model weights. Using the `device_map` argument requires the ðŸ¤— [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)
package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade accelerate
```

The following code automatically loads and stores model weights across devices:

```py
transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", device_map="auto")
```

Note that if  `device_map="auto"` is passed, there is no need to add the argument `device=device` when instantiating your `pipeline` as you may encounter some unexpected behavior!

### Batch size

By default, pipelines will not batch inference for reasons explained in detail [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#pipeline-batching). The reason is that batching is not necessarily faster, and can actually be quite slower in some cases.

But if it works in your use case, you can use:

```py
transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", device=0, batch_size=2)
audio_filenames = [f"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/{i}.flac" for i in range(1, 5)]
texts = transcriber(audio_filenames)
```

This runs the pipeline on the 4 provided audio files, but it will pass them in batches of 2
to the model (which is on a GPU, where batching is more likely to help) without requiring any further code from you. 
The output should always match what you would have received without batching. It is only meant as a way to help you get more speed out of a pipeline.

Pipelines can also alleviate some of the complexities of batching because, for some pipelines, a single item (like a long audio file) needs to be chunked into multiple parts to be processed by a model. The pipeline performs this [*chunk batching*](./main_classes/pipelines#pipeline-chunk-batching) for you.

### Task specific parameters

All tasks provide task specific parameters which allow for additional flexibility and options to help you get your job done.
For instance, the [`transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline.__call__`] method has a `return_timestamps` parameter which sounds promising for subtitling videos:


```py
>>> transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", return_timestamps=True)
>>> transcriber("https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac")
{'text': ' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.', 'chunks': [{'timestamp': (0.0, 11.88), 'text': ' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its'}, {'timestamp': (11.88, 12.38), 'text': ' creed.'}]}
```

As you can see, the model inferred the text and also outputted **when** the various sentences were pronounced.

There are many parameters available for each task, so check out each task's API reference to see what you can tinker with!
For instance, the [`~transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline`] has a `chunk_length_s` parameter which is helpful 
for working on really long audio files (for example, subtitling entire movies or hour-long videos) that a model typically 
cannot handle on its own:

```python
>>> transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", chunk_length_s=30, return_timestamps=True)
>>> transcriber("https://huggingface.co/datasets/sanchit-gandhi/librispeech_long/resolve/main/audio.wav")
{'text': " Chapter 16. I might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines, but I wanted you to see every step by which we came.  I, too, agree to whatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite to be unable to live apart from me. It was the day after the evening...
```

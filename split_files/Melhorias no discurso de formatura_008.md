Your graduation speech is a well-crafted and emotionally resonant piece. It touches on various aspects of the academic journey, including both the technical and personal growth that students experience. You successfully integrate a recognition of the diversity of fields and backgrounds, which is likely to make the audience feel seen and acknowledged. The speech also includes a balance of challenges and triumphs, adding a layer of authenticity.

Some specific points:

1. **Technical Learning vs. Life Learning**: You effectively contrast the technical skills acquired with the life skills and personal development, making the speech relatable to a broad range of graduates.
  
2. **Acknowledgment of Challenges**: The speech is grounded by acknowledging the various difficulties students may have faced, such as being away from family, balancing work and school, or dealing with health issues. This adds a layer of realism and may resonate strongly with your audience.
  
3. **Interactive Element**: Asking the audience to close their eyes and reflect adds an interactive and introspective component, which is a nice touch.

4. **Gratitude Section**: Acknowledging the contributions of family, friends, faculty, and staff gives a well-rounded perspective and pays homage to the collective effort involved in reaching this milestone.

5. **Conclusive Note**: You conclude with the idea that the end is also a new beginning, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and excitement for the future.

However, there are some areas that could be improved:

1. **Flow & Pacing**: While the content is rich, the speech could benefit from smoother transitions between topics. This would improve the flow and make the delivery more impactful.

2. **Specific Anecdotes**: While you touch on general themes effectively, adding a specific anecdote or two could make the speech even more relatable and memorable.

3. **Minor Language Details**: The speech is in Portuguese, and while it's mostly well-written, there are a few places where the language could be polished for better readability and impact.

Overall, it's a strong speech that covers a lot of ground and is likely to resonate with many in your audience.

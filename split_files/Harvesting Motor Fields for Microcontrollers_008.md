In theory, you could harvest energy from a motor's magnetic field to power a microcontroller, but there are several practical challenges and constraints:

1. **Efficiency**: The process of converting the magnetic field to electrical energy may not be very efficient. 

2. **Interference**: Harvesting energy from a motor could affect its performance or introduce electromagnetic interference.

3. **Power Requirement**: Microcontrollers require a certain amount of power to operate reliably. The energy harvested should meet or exceed this requirement.

4. **Regulation**: The harvested energy may need to be regulated to provide a stable voltage and current for the microcontroller.

5. **Implementation**: This would require a well-designed coil and circuitry to capture, store, and regulate the energy.

6. **Physical Constraints**: Size and weight of the harvesting setup could be a limitation, especially for small motors.

Given your background in software engineering, you may be interested to know that the software running on the microcontroller could be optimized for low power consumption to make such a system more feasible.

The feasibility depends on the specific requirements of your microcontroller, the characteristics of the motor, and how close you can place the harvesting mechanism to the motor. Would you like to delve into some calculations or a proof-of-concept design?

Certainly, let's start by writing the C code to simulate the sensor data generator. I'll include functions for initializing the sensor, fetching the next sensor data, and freeing the sensor handle.

Here's the C code outline:

1. `init_sensor(double freq_x, double freq_y, double freq_z)`: Initializes the sensor with given frequencies for each axis and returns a handle (pointer) to the sensor structure.
2. `next_sensor_data(void *handle, double *x, double *y, double *z)`: Fetches the next sensor data based on the sine and cosine functions, with some noise added.
3. `free_sensor(void *handle)`: Frees the sensor handle.

After writing the code, I'll compile it into a shared library using `gcc`.

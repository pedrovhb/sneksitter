### Use Cases for Synchronous Iterators

Synchronous iterators are incredibly versatile and are used in various types of applications:

1. **File Reading**: When reading a file line by line, where each line is processed before the next is read.
  
    ```python
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print(line.strip())
    ```

2. **Database Query Processing**: When each database record needs to be processed before fetching the next one.
  
    ```python
    for record in query_result:
        process(record)
    ```

3. **Data Transformation Pipelines**: When you have a series of transformations that need to be applied in a specific order.

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    squared = [x * x for x in numbers]
    ```

I'll proceed to Part 2 in the next response, focusing on asynchronous iterators.

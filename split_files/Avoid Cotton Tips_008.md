Using cotton tips to clean your dog's ears is generally not recommended by veterinarians. The issue with cotton swabs is that they can push debris and wax further down into the ear canal, potentially causing impaction or even damaging the eardrum. Instead, it's advisable to use a liquid ear cleaner specifically designed for dogs, along with a soft cloth or gauze to wipe the ear gently.

If your dog has an ear infection or another ear-related issue, consult your veterinarian for the appropriate treatment.

Dog whining during meal preparation can be attributed to several factors, such as excitement, impatience, or even a learned behavior to get your attention. Dogs don't have the same concept of time as humans do, so the act of preparing food can feel prolonged for them. Additionally, the anticipation of food could trigger an emotional response like whining. 

If the whining becomes problematic, you might consider training strategies to encourage patience and calm behavior. This could involve asking for a "sit" or "stay" before mealtime and rewarding only when your dog complies.

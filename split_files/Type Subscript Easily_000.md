Typing subscript text often depends on the context or environment in which you're working. Here are some common ways:

### General Text Editors:
1. **Word Processors (MS Word, Google Docs, etc.)**: Usually have an option to format text as subscript. Typically, you can highlight the text and then select "Subscript" from the format menu or use a shortcut like `Ctrl + =`.
2. **Rich Text Editors (Markdown, Jupyter, etc.)**: These often use HTML-like or LaTeX-like tags for subscript. For example, in Markdown, you can use HTML tags: `<sub>subscript</sub>`. In Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX notation like `\( x_{1} \)` can be used.

### Programming:
1. **Python**: Python doesn't have built-in support for subscript in string literals. However, you can use Unicode subscript characters for integers and some lowercase letters.
    ```python
    print("H₂O")  # Using Unicode subscript
    ```
2. **LaTeX**: You can use the underscore `_` to indicate subscript: `x_{subscript}`.
3. **HTML/CSS**: Use the `<sub>` tag for subscript.

### Shell:
Since you're using the fish shell, there's no native support for subscript characters in most shells, including fish. However, some terminal emulators may support Unicode subscript characters.

### Code Comments:
In code comments, subscript is generally not supported. However, you can use notations like `x[i]` to indicate "x subscript i".

### Custom Key Bindings:
If you frequently use subscript characters, you could set up custom key bindings to insert these characters more easily. How to do this would depend on your OS and text editor.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these methods?

What about in the browser or in general in Windows?

In Windows and while using a web browser, there are various methods to type subscript text:

### In a Web Browser:

1. **Rich Text Areas**: Some web forms with rich text capabilities (like Google Docs or some forum editors) have a toolbar option for subscript. Look for a button that usually has a small number like "₂".
   
2. **HTML Tags**: If you're editing HTML or a web-based platform that supports HTML, you can use the `<sub>` tag to create subscript text: `<sub>your text here</sub>`.

3. **JavaScript**: If you're developing a web page, you can programmatically set subscript text using JavaScript by modifying the `verticalAlign` CSS property.
   ```javascript
   element.style.verticalAlign = "sub";
   ```

### In Windows:

1. **Character Map**: You can open the Character Map utility in Windows, locate the subscript character you need, and then copy-paste it. 

2. **Alt Codes**: Some subscript numbers can be typed using the Alt key plus a numeric code. For example, Alt+8322 produces a subscript 2 (²).

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts in Word Processors**: In Microsoft Word and similar software, you can usually toggle subscript on/off with `Ctrl + =`.

4. **AutoHotkey Script**: If you frequently need to type subscript characters, you could use a tool like AutoHotkey to create custom keyboard shortcuts.

5. **On-Screen Keyboard**: You can also use Windows' On-Screen Keyboard (`osk.exe`) to click on special characters, though this is more cumbersome.

6. **Unicode Input**: Some applications allow you to input Unicode characters directly by holding down `Alt` and typing the Unicode code point. For example, the code for subscript 2 is `U+2082`, so you'd hold down `Alt` and then type `2082` (may require enabling 'hex numpad' in Windows).

Would you like more details on any of these methods?

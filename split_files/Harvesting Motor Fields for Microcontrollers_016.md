### Steps for Software
1. **Initialize Low-Power Modes**: Use available libraries or directly manipulate registers to enable low-power modes.
2. **Use Interrupts**: Use hardware interrupts for task triggering to minimize active CPU time.

Given your background, you'd likely find the software optimization particularly interesting. The software can be programmed to wake up the ATtiny85 only when necessary, reducing the average power needed.

Would you like to go into the specifics of any of these components, or perhaps see a sample circuit diagram or code snippet for the ATtiny85?

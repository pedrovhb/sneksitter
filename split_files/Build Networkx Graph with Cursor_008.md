To solve this problem, you can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the highly nested recursive data structure while using the traversal cursor. At each node, you'll perform the following steps:

1. Add the current node to the networkx graph.
2. Go to the first child of the current node, if any, and add an edge between the current node and this child in the graph.
3. Perform DFS on this child.
4. After returning from the child, go to the next sibling and repeat steps 2-4 until there are no more siblings.
5. Finally, go back to the parent node.

Here's a Python snippet to demonstrate how you could do this using the `networkx` library. I'm assuming the traversal cursor provides three methods: `go_to_first_child()`, `go_to_next_sibling()`, and `go_to_parent()`.

```python
import networkx as nx

class TraversalCursor:
    def go_to_first_child(self):
        # Implement this
        pass

    def go_to_next_sibling(self):
        # Implement this
        pass
    
    def go_to_parent(self):
        # Implement this
        pass

def build_tree(cursor: TraversalCursor, graph: nx.DiGraph, current_node: str):
    child = cursor.go_to_first_child()
    
    while child is not None:
        # Add child node and edge from current_node to child in the graph
        graph.add_node(child)
        graph.add_edge(current_node, child)
        
        # Recursively build tree starting from the child
        build_tree(cursor, graph, child)
        
        # Move cursor to the next sibling
        child = cursor.go_to_next_sibling()
        
    # Move cursor back to the parent
    cursor.go_to_parent()

# Initialize networkx graph and traversal cursor
G = nx.DiGraph()
cursor = TraversalCursor()

# Start building the tree from the root node
root_node = "root"
G.add_node(root_node)
build_tree(cursor, G, root_node)
```

Here, `G` is a directed graph object from the `networkx` library that will contain the tree structure. The `TraversalCursor` is an abstraction of your traversal cursor. The function `build_tree` performs the DFS traversal and graph construction.

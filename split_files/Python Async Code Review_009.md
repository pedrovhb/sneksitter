### Main Components:
1. **Type Annotations and Protocols**: You have done an excellent job of providing rich type annotations for both input parameters and return types. Using `Protocol` and `TypeVar` here gives you the power of dynamic typing while also allowing strong type checks. The type variables are correctly defined with co- and contravariant markers.
   
2. **Sync and Async Abstraction**: The script provides `SyncCallable` and `AsyncCallable` protocols, and utility functions to ensure an iterable or callable is asynchronous. This is an elegant way to generalize synchronous and asynchronous operations.

3. **AsyncStream**: The main class wraps around an async iterator and provides utility methods for mapping, filtering, flattening, etc., while retaining the async nature of the operations.

4. **Operator Overloading**: For syntactic sugar, you've also overloaded operators to work as shorthand for mapping, filtering, etc.

5. **Reveal Types**: You've made liberal use of `reveal_type()` for debugging, but it seems you've implemented it to display information at runtime, which is atypical for this function (usually used for type checkers like `mypy`).

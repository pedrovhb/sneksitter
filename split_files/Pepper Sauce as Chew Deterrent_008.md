Using pepper sauce or a similar spicy substance as a deterrent for a puppy chewing on furniture is a commonly tried method. The idea is that the unpleasant taste will discourage the puppy from continuing the behavior. However, the effectiveness of this approach can vary depending on several factors:

1. **Tolerance to Spiciness**: Some dogs may not be as sensitive to spicy or bitter substances.
  
2. **Consistency**: You'd need to consistently apply the deterrent to maintain its effectiveness. 

3. **Safety**: Make sure that the substance used is safe for pets. Some substances can be harmful if ingested in large amounts or if they come in contact with the eyes.

4. **Behavioral Factors**: Sometimes chewing can be a symptom of other issues like separation anxiety or lack of exercise. In such cases, merely applying a deterrent may not solve the underlying problem.

5. **Alternative Outlets**: Providing appropriate chew toys can offer a positive alternative to destructive chewing.

6. **Training**: Positive reinforcement training to encourage good behavior can be more effective in the long term.

If you decide to try using pepper sauce or another deterrent, you should first test a small amount to make sure it doesn't stain or damage the furniture. Additionally, observe your pet's reaction to ensure it doesn't cause discomfort beyond the intended deterrence.

So, while it might work, it's not a guaranteed or comprehensive solution. It's often better to address the root cause of the chewing behavior through training and providing appropriate outlets for your puppy's energy.

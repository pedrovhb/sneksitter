The validation process produced an output that is too large to display entirely. Nonetheless, the Pydantic models were able to successfully validate the structure of the `grammar.json` data, meaning that the models accurately represent the data structure.

Would you like to proceed with exporting these Pydantic models to a Python file, or is there anything else you'd like to do?

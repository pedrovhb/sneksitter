# Assistant

Certainly, let's go through a slice of the entire process using a simplified example. I'll demonstrate this for a basic calculator feature that performs addition and multiplication.

### Step 1: Define Requirements

Here's how one might write the requirements in a Gherkin-like language:

```gherkin
Feature: Basic Calculator
  Scenario: Addition
    Given two numbers a and b
    When I add a and b
    Then I get a result that is the sum of a and b

  Scenario: Multiplication
    Given two numbers x and y
    When I multiply x by y
    Then I get a result that is the product of x and y
```

### Step 2: Parse and Interpret

The interpreter would parse these scenarios and translate them into a more structured format. This might look something like:

```python
scenarios = {
    'Addition': {
        'Given': 'two numbers a and b',
        'When': 'I add a and b',
        'Then': 'I get a result that is the sum of a and b'
    },
    'Multiplication': {
        'Given': 'two numbers x and y',
        'When': 'I multiply x by y',
        'Then': 'I get a result that is the product of x and y'
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Code Generation

Based on these parsed scenarios, the AI code generator could produce Python code for the calculator. I'll go ahead and generate some basic Python code based on the above scenarios.

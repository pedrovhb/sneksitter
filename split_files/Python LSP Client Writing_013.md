### Language Server Protocol (LSP)

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a protocol used between a text editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like autocomplete, go to definition, find all references, etc. It was developed by Microsoft and is used in various code editors like VSCode, Sublime Text, and IntelliJ IDEA. LSP operates over JSON-RPC, usually using either standard I/O streams or a TCP/IP connection.

#### Features

- **Auto-completion**: Suggests completions based on the current code context.
- **Syntax highlighting**: Provides highlighting rules for the language.
- **Code navigation**: Jump to definition, find references, etc.
- **Linting**: Real-time error checking and suggestions.
- **Code formatting**: Auto-format code based on language-specific rules.
  
#### Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The client sends an initialization request to establish a connection.
2. **Feature Negotiation**: Both client and server negotiate features they support.
3. **Requests and Responses**: Client sends requests for features (e.g., autocomplete), and the server responds with the necessary data.

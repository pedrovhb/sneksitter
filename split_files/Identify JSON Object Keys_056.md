Based on the plots and their behavior over time, here are some educated guesses about what each column might represent:

- `kff1005`: The values are fairly constant but with some fluctuations. It could represent a temperature sensor reading, likely ambient temperature.
  
- `kff1006`: This plot also shows fairly constant behavior with fluctuations, possibly another temperature-related metric, such as engine coolant temperature.

- `kff1001`: The values are mostly zero but spike at intervals. This could be related to RPM or some other metric that changes significantly only during certain events.

- `kff1007`: The values are mostly zero with occasional spikes, similar to `kff1001`. It might be another event-driven metric, perhaps related to steering angle or wheel position.

- `k47`: The data seems to stay around a constant value with some small fluctuations. This could be a percentage metric like throttle position, which would generally stay around the same value during steady driving.

- `kff1202`: The values are mostly negative and show some fluctuation. This could represent a pressure sensor, possibly related to the intake manifold.

- `k42`: The data is fairly constant, which suggests it could be a sensor value that doesn't change much under the observed conditions, like a constant-speed driving scenario.

These are educated guesses based on the data's behavior over time and may not be accurate without additional context. Would you like to further analyze any specific columns?

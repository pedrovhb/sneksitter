Designing a code review template for large language models like GPT-4 involves multiple considerations:

### Structure and Formatting
1. **Markdown Headers**: Use markdown headers to structure the template into sections for different aspects of the review, like "Readability", "Performance", etc.
2. **Indentation**: Use proper indentation to differentiate between main points and sub-points.
3. **Comments and Placeholders**: Include placeholders or comments to guide the model on what to focus on in each section.

### Content
1. **Readability**: Include a section for reviewing code readability, commenting on naming conventions, comments, and code organization.
2. **Performance**: Evaluate the efficiency of the code, both time and space complexity.
3. **Error Handling**: Examine how the code handles possible errors or exceptions.
4. **Test Coverage**: Analyze if the code is well-tested or if additional tests are needed.
5. **Security**: Review the code for any security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.
6. **Consistency**: Make sure the code follows the project's coding guidelines or standards.

### Interactivity
1. **Prompts for Human Input**: The template should have prompts or placeholders where human expertise is critical.
2. **Decision Points**: Include decision trees or flowcharts to guide the model through complex evaluations.

### Extensibility
1. **Customization**: Allow for the template to be easily customized for specific languages or frameworks.
2. **Versioning**: Keep track of template versions, especially if the template will be used in a CI/CD pipeline.

### Usability
1. **Length**: The template should be detailed but not so long that it becomes cumbersome to use.
2. **Clarity**: Instructions should be clear and unambiguous to ensure accurate code reviews.

### Automation
1. **Integrate with Tools**: The template should be designed in a way that it could be easily integrated with code review tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

By considering these factors, you can design a template that is comprehensive, easy to use, and effective in guiding the model to perform in-depth code reviews. Would you like to proceed with creating a sample template?

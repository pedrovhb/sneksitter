The mantis shrimp's punch is extraordinarily powerful for its size, capable of breaking glass aquarium walls and shattering the shells of its prey. However, the scale of the animal is much smaller than that of a human, so while a strike from a mantis shrimp could cause injury, it's unlikely to be life-threatening to a person.

The kind of injury you might expect would depend on the size of the mantis shrimp and the specific circumstances of the encounter. Potential injuries could include:

- **Cuts and Lacerations**: The speed and force of the punch could break the skin.
- **Bruising**: Given the force of the impact, bruising is likely.
- **Puncture Wounds**: Some species have sharp points on their dactyl clubs, which could result in a puncture.

Despite its small size, the mantis shrimp's punch can generate forces exceeding 1,500 Newtons, and the acceleration can be comparable to a .22 caliber bullet. Therefore, while not life-threatening, a punch from a mantis shrimp would certainly be painful and could require medical attention.

### Semantics

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Given that LLMs work sequentially, a language with lazy evaluation could allow the model to generate code without needing to backtrack often.
  
2. **Immutable Data Structures**: This would simplify the task for the AI because it wouldn't have to track state changes across different parts of the code.

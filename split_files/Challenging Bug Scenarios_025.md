### Possible Ideas for Complex Scenario

1. **Database Migration Script**
    - Twist 1: The script works fine for smaller databases but fails for larger ones due to a hidden SQL transaction issue.
    - Twist 2: A specific column's data gets corrupted, but only if it contains certain special characters.
    - Twist 3: The script logs its steps, but the logger itself has a bug that swallows specific error messages, making debugging harder.

2. **Web Scraping for Data Aggregation**
    - Twist 1: The scraper has an off-by-one error in pagination, which only triggers when the total number of pages is prime.
    - Twist 2: Occasionally fails to scrape data due to rate-limiting, but the program mistakes it for a parsing error.
    - Twist 3: Encodes special characters incorrectly, but only when multiple conditions involving text length and HTML tags are met.

3. **Time Series Data Analysis for Stock Prices**
    - Twist 1: The analysis fails at market opening and closing times but works fine otherwise.
    - Twist 2: Gives incorrect predictions for stocks with ticker symbols containing numerical characters.
    - Twist 3: Misses out on including the very first and last data points due to an indexing error, which becomes significant only for specific calculations.

4. **File System Watcher for Automatic Backup**
    - Twist 1: Fails to backup files that are modified within the first minute of system uptime.
    - Twist 2: Works for all files but fails for hidden files (.gitignore, .env, etc.).
    - Twist 3: If two files are modified at the exact same second, one of them doesn't get backed up.

5. **Natural Language Processor for Customer Reviews**
    - Twist 1: Fails for reviews that contain more than three different languages.
    - Twist 2: Incorrectly classifies reviews as positive or negative when they contain certain idioms or phrases.
    - Twist 3: Due to a regex error, sometimes omits important sentences in reviews if they contain email addresses or URLs.

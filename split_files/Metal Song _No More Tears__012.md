It sounds like you're quoting lyrics or poetic lines. These phrases evoke a sense of urgency and fleeting moments, perhaps emphasizing the importance of seizing opportunities before they're gone. While I can't interpret the emotional nuances as a human might, they do fit into a common theme often explored in various forms of art: the impermanence of time and the need to make the most of it. Is there a specific context or question you have about these lines?

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the oversight. In a production setting, you would directly include the full header files provided by the JPEG XL C API library, which would define all structs, enums, and function signatures in detail. This would allow the CFFI module to understand the full API and generate appropriate Python bindings.

For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume we have a complete header file, `jxl_complete.h`, that fully describes the JPEG XL C API. Normally, this header would be provided by the library authors, but for demonstration purposes, we'll assume it exists.

### Steps to Create CFFI Bindings

1. **Install CFFI**: If you haven't already, install the cffi package.
    ```bash
    pip install cffi
    ```

2. **Create a `build_jxl_cffi.py` File**: This file will contain Python code to read the C header and create Python bindings.

    ```python
    from cffi import FFI

    ffi = FFI()

    # Assuming jxl_complete.h contains the complete set of function prototypes, enums and structs
    with open("jxl_complete.h") as f:
        ffi.cdef(f.read())

    ffi.set_source(
        "_jxl_cffi",
        '#include "jxl_complete.h"',
        libraries=["jxl"],
    )

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        ffi.compile()
    ```

3. **Compile the CFFI Module**: Run the `build_jxl_cffi.py` script to compile the CFFI module.
    ```bash
    python build_jxl_cffi.py
    ```
    This will generate a `_jxl_cffi.c` source file and a `_jxl_cffi.abi3.so` shared object (or equivalent on your system).

4. **Use the CFFI Module in Python Code**: Now you can use `_jxl_cffi` in your Python code to call the JPEG XL C API functions.

    ```python
    from _jxl_cffi import ffi, lib

    # Example: Using the JxlEncoderMake function
    encoder = lib.JxlEncoderMake(ffi.NULL)
    ```

5. **Translate the Example Program**: The C++ example would need to be translated to Python, making use of the `_jxl_cffi` module for the JPEG XL specific functionality. This involves translating file

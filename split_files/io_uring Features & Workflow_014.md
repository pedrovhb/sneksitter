#### Example 2: HTTP Server Handling Multiple Clients

1. **State 1: Initialization**
    - Create an io_uring instance.
    - Bind to a socket and listen.

2. **State 2: Accept Connection**
    - Submit an accept request to the submission queue.

3. **State 3: Read Request**
    - After a connection is accepted, submit a read request to read the HTTP header.

4. **State 4: Write Response**
    - Once the header is read and parsed, submit a write request to send the HTTP response.

5. **State 5: Close Connection**
    - Submit a close request for the client socket.

6. **State 6: Loop or Terminate**
    - Go back to State 2 for accepting more connections or terminate.

These state machines are simplified for the sake of explanation. In a real-world application, error handling, timeouts, and other edge cases would also be part of the workflow.

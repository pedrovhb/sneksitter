How do we query for an arbitrary subgraph structure within a graph in networkx? e.g. if we generalized networkx to integrate with ASTs, how would we query for nodes?

Querying for an arbitrary subgraph structure within a graph in NetworkX is a non-trivial task and generally falls under the domain of subgraph isomorphism. NetworkX doesn't provide built-in high-level query mechanisms for subgraph structures. However, it does provide low-level graph manipulation functionalities that you can use to implement your custom query mechanism.

### Approaches:

1. **Subgraph Isomorphism**: One way to find a particular subgraph structure is to use subgraph isomorphism algorithms. NetworkX provides `is_isomorphic` and `subgraph_is_isomorphic` methods, but these are generally not efficient for large graphs or complex queries.

2. **Custom Traversal**: You can implement custom traversal algorithms based on BFS or DFS to look for specific patterns or attributes within nodes and edges.

3. **Attribute-based Filtering**: If your nodes and edges have attributes, you could filter based on these. However, this is not as powerful as querying for structural patterns.

4. **Convert to Another Format for Querying**: You might find it beneficial to convert the graph into a different data structure optimized for querying. For example, you could use graph databases like Neo4j which provide powerful query languages like Cypher.

### Generalized to ASTs:

If you're looking to generalize NetworkX to integrate with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), you'll need to consider how to represent the AST nodes and edges in NetworkX. Once represented, querying can be done using the above methods. ASTs often have labeled edges (e.g., "left" and "right" for a binary tree), so you'll likely need to use a MultiDiGraph in NetworkX to accurately capture the AST structure.

### Code Example:

Here's a simple example using `subgraph_is_isomorphic` to find subgraphs in a DiGraph. This won't directly apply to ASTs but demonstrates the concept.

First, let's install the necessary package for this demonstration.

The code found a subgraph in `G` that is isomorphic to `P`. The subgraph is represented by the mapping `{1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5}`, meaning that node 1 in `P` corresponds to node 3 in `G`, node 2 in `P` corresponds to node 4 in `G`, and so on.

This is a simplified example, but you can extend this to handle more complex scenarios, including those involving ASTs. If you have specific requirements or queries, additional logic can be added to the traversal or matching process.

Let's design a surrogate-like querying interface for networkx. It'll provide singleton classes intercepting any operations and creating with them a predicate matcher which searches the graph for subgraphs that satisfy it. Examples are more communicative:

G = ...

my_queriable: QueryWrapper[NodeT, EdgeT] = QueryWrapper(G)  # Empty query stack

top_level_function_and_class_defs = my_queriable.root >> N.node_type == "module" >> (N.node_type=="function_definition" | N.node_type == "class_definition" | N.node_type == "decorated_definition")  # returns QueryWrapper with the given predicate in the query stack
print(top_level_function_and_class_defs.resolve())

Creating a surrogate-like querying interface for NetworkX with singleton classes that intercept operations and build up a predicate matcher is a fascinating idea. This would essentially be a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for querying graphs. Below is a design proposal for the `QueryWrapper` class, along with a few auxiliary classes.

1. **QueryWrapper**: This class wraps the original NetworkX graph and holds the query stack. It's the primary interface for the user.
2. **QueryNode**: A class to hold individual queries (predicates) and logic for combining them.
3. **NodeWrapper**: A wrapper around the original node data to allow us to use the special syntax for queries.

### Design:

1. **Singleton Design**: Given that the queries are stateful operations on the graph, singleton classes would be responsible for accumulating the state (predicates and relationships).
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The query would not be executed until explicitly requested by calling `.resolve()`.

Let's start by defining the core classes:

1. **QueryNode**: Holds individual queries and provides the logic for combining them.
2. **QueryWrapper**: Holds a stack of `QueryNode`s and provides methods for adding to this stack and resolving it.

I'll use Python's `dataclasses` for brevity and type annotations for clarity. Since the task is complex, I'll start by defining the `QueryNode` class.

The `QueryNode` class holds a predicate function that takes a node and returns a boolean. It also has optional fields for a logical operation (`'and'` or `'or'`) and a reference to the next `QueryNode` in the chain.

Now let's move on to the `QueryWrapper` class. This class will wrap around a NetworkX graph and hold a stack of `QueryNode`s. It will also have a method called `resolve()` that will evaluate the stack of queries against the graph to find matching subgraphs.

It looks like we have a TypeError due to the way I implemented the `__or__` and `__and__` methods in `NodeWrapper`. The issue is that the right-hand side of the `|` operator is a string, which is not compatible with `NodeWrapper`.

I'll fix this by updating the custom operations for `NodeWrapper` to handle such cases.

It seems the issue persists; the problem lies in the Python operator precedence. The `==` operator has higher precedence than the `|` operator, causing the TypeError. To address this, I'll need to wrap the comparisons in parentheses to ensure that each `==` operation is evaluated first, followed by the `|` operations.

I apologize for the oversight. The problem isn't with operator precedence but with the actual logic in the `__or__` and `__and__` methods of `NodeWrapper`. The issue is that when the `|` operator is encountered, Python is trying to apply it between a string and a `NodeWrapper` object, which isn't defined.

To address this, I'll modify the `NodeWrapper` methods to handle these types correctly. Specifically, I'll change the `__or__` and `__and__` methods to create a new `NodeWrapper` that contains a lambda function combining the two predicates.

It's still precedence issues, should be

my_queriable.add_predicate((N == "function_definition") | (N == "class_definition") | (N == "decorated_definition")).predicate, logical_op="or")

You're correct, and I apologize for the misunderstanding. The precedence issue does indeed affect how the expressions are evaluated. Your corrected line of code should resolve the issue. Let's try it.

The code now runs without errors but doesn't produce the expected result. The reason is that I failed to implement the logic to evaluate chained queries in the `resolve` method of `QueryWrapper`. Currently, it's just running `all(query_node.evaluate(node) for query_node in self.query_stack)`, which will only work correctly if all the queries are logically ANDed together.

I'll go ahead and implement a more robust evaluation method that handles the logical operations ('and', 'or') between the queries.

The issue here is that `self.graph.nodes(data=True)` returns a tuple `(node, data_dict)` for each node. I didn't account for that in the predicate evaluation, which expects a dictionary representing the node data. I'll fix this by unpacking the tuple and passing only the data dictionary to the predicate functions.

The issue here is with the generic type instantiation of `QueryWrapper`. Python's type system is getting confused because `QueryWrapper` is a generic class. I'll go ahead and remove the generic type arguments when instantiating `QueryWrapper` to resolve this issue. Given the complexity of the current code, these generics don't seem to be adding any value anyway.

You're correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The comment was intended to indicate that the other methods remain unchanged, but in Python, redefining the class actually wipes out the previous definitions of the methods. Let's correct this by redefining the full `QueryWrapper` class, including the missing methods, and then rerun the `resolve()` function.

The issue is with the `evaluate_stack` method. The predicate for each `QueryNode` should return a boolean value, but it appears that it's returning a `NodeWrapper` object instead. This is likely due to how the predicates are defined and added to the `QueryNode`.

Let's debug this by printing out what the predicate actually returns when evaluated.

The debugging output confirms the issue: the second predicate is returning a `NodeWrapper` object instead of a boolean. This is likely due to how the `predicate` field is set in `QueryNode` when adding a new predicate using `add_predicate`.

Upon reviewing the code, it looks like the issue is with the line:

```python
my_queriable.add_predicate(((N == "function_definition") | (N == "class_definition") | (N == "decorated_definition")).predicate, logical_op="or")
```

Here, the `predicate` attribute of the `NodeWrapper` object is being passed as a predicate to `add_predicate`, which is incorrect. I should have used the `predicate` lambda function directly.

Let's correct this and rerun the `resolve()` function.

It appears that the issue persists. Let's debug the predicate lambda function directly to see what it returns when evaluated against a sample node data dictionary. This will help us identify whether the issue is with the predicate or the way it's being used in the query stack.

The issue is now evident: the `correct_predicate` is still returning a `NodeWrapper` object. I made an oversight in the usage of the `NodeWrapper` class while forming the predicate. The `.predicate` attribute should contain a lambda function that evaluates to a boolean, but it appears to contain a `NodeWrapper` object.

I'll rectify this issue by ensuring that the `.predicate` attribute actually contains a boolean-evaluating lambda function.

The debugging output shows that the `correct_predicate` now evaluates to a boolean (`False` in this case), which is expected behavior. However, the final result of `my_queriable.resolve()` is an empty list, which suggests that no nodes in the graph match the query. This is likely because the query is asking for nodes that are both "module" and one of "function_definition", "class_definition", or "decorated_definition", which is not possible based on the sample graph.

The logical operations between the queries are not yet implemented to behave like a DSL, where ">>" could mean logical AND between queries, for instance. As it stands, all predicates are considered in a single logical context, which is not what you initially aimed for.

Would you like to proceed with modifying the code to support such DSL-like behavior?

Yes. Let's step back and think about the surrogate design in isolation, for now. What's the ultimate goal, in an even more generic sense than class matching, for capturing applied operations to a surrogate? How can the surrogate allow such operations be chained and composed? What advanced Python features could we leverage to achieve this? (please provide multiple possible alternatives to each sub-problem). Explore the space in ~1000 words.

# Assistant

The ultimate goal of a surrogate design pattern, particularly in the context of query construction, is to provide a mechanism to capture and defer the execution of operations applied to an object. This is done in a way that allows these operations to be inspected, altered, or executed at a later point in time. The surrogate acts as a stand-in for the actual object, intercepting operations and storing them until they're resolved against the real object.

### Chaining and Composition:

1. **Method Chaining**: One common approach is to have each method on the surrogate return a new instance of the surrogate, modified to include the new operation. This enables chainable APIs like `obj.method1().method2().method3()`.

2. **Operator Overloading**: Python's dunder methods can be overridden to capture operations like addition, equality, bitwise operations, etc., which can then be stored in the surrogate.

3. **Context Managers**: Using Python's `with` statement, you can establish a context where operations are captured and then executed when exiting the context.

4. **Functional Composition**: Functions representing operations can be composed using higher-order functions.

### Advanced Python Features:

1. **Decorators**: These could wrap methods to capture their arguments and add them to a stack of operations to be executed later.
  
2. **Descriptors**: Use descriptors to capture operations on attributes. The `__get__` and `__set__` methods can be utilized to capture read and write operations.

3. **Metaclasses**: A metaclass could automatically add capturing behavior to each method of the surrogate class.

4. **Generators and Coroutines**: These could be used to lazily evaluate operations, particularly useful if the operations are expensive or dependent on external resources.

5. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: Define an interface for both the real object and the surrogate, ensuring they can be used interchangeably.

6. **Monkey Patching**: Though generally not recommended, this could be used in a controlled manner to add behavior to classes that weren't designed to be surrogates.

7. **Dynamic Attribute Assignment**: Python’s `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` can be overridden to dynamically handle attribute access and modification, thus enabling capturing of such operations.

### Alternatives:

1. **Immutable vs Mutable Surrogates**: 
    - Immutable surrogates return a new instance for each operation, making them safer but potentially less efficient.
    - Mutable surrogates modify their internal state, which can be more efficient but introduces the risk of side effects.

2. **Eager vs Lazy Evaluation**: 
    - Eager evaluation would execute operations as they are applied but defer the application to the real object.
    - Lazy evaluation stores the operations and applies them only when explicitly requested.

3. **External DSL vs Internal DSL**: 
    - An external DSL would involve a custom query language parsed at runtime.
    - An internal DSL uses the host language's (Python, in this case) syntax for queries, making it easier to integrate but potentially less powerful.

4. **Stateful vs Stateless Surrogates**: 
    - A stateful surrogate would remember past operations, allowing for more complex queries.
    - A stateless surrogate would not, making it simpler but less flexible.

By thoughtfully combining these techniques, you can build a powerful, flexible, and efficient surrogate-based querying interface. The choice of techniques would depend on the specific requirements of your use case.

### Immutable Surrogates

In an immutable design, each operation applied to the surrogate would return a new instance of the surrogate, encapsulating the new state. This is the safest option for multi-threaded environments.

#### Operator Overloading

Python allows the overloading of operators by defining special methods like `__add__`, `__eq__`, etc. In an immutable design, these would return a new instance of the surrogate with the operation added to

Great, let's delve into the different approaches for implementing a Surrogate with the characteristics of being Immutable, Eager, and an Internal DSL. I'll outline how each of the advanced Python features could be leveraged for this implementation.

### Operator Overloading

1. **Immutable**: Each overloaded operator would return a new Surrogate object, ensuring immutability. 
2. **Eager**: The operators could eagerly validate or partially evaluate the operation, storing any intermediate results for future use.
3. **Internal DSL**: Operator overloading naturally lends itself to DSL-like syntax. For example, `surrogate + 3` could be translated into a specific query operation.
   
#### Code Snippet:
```python
class Surrogate:
    def __add__(self, other):
        new_instance = self.clone()  # Ensuring immutability
        new_instance.eager_evaluate_add(other)  # Eager evaluation
        return new_instance
```

### Functional Composition

1. **Immutable**: The function returned from composition would produce a new Surrogate instance when called.
2. **Eager**: Functions could execute some logic immediately upon composition.
3. **Internal DSL**: The composition itself could look like a DSL, especially when combined with custom operators or methods.

#### Code Snippet:
```python
def compose(f, g):
    def h(x):
        new_x = f(x).clone()
        return g(new_x)
    return h
```

### Context Managers

1. **Immutable**: A new Surrogate could be returned when exiting the context.
2. **Eager**: Operations within the context could be eagerly validated or executed.
3. **Internal DSL**: While not directly contributing to DSL characteristics, the context could establish a scope within which DSL-like operations are valid.

#### Code Snippet:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def surrogate_context(surrogate):
    try:
        yield surrogate.clone()
    finally:
        surrogate.eager_finalize()
```

### Metaclasses

Metaclasses could be used to enforce the Surrogate's characteristics across multiple classes, for instance, ensuring that all methods return a new instance for immutability or perform eager evaluation.

#### Code Snippet:
```python
class SurrogateMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Modify dct to enforce immutability, eager evaluation, etc.
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
```

### Dynamic Attribute Access

1. **Dynamic Descriptors**: Descriptors with dynamically generated `__get__` and `__set__` methods can be used to capture attribute operations, which can be particularly useful for DSL-like attribute chaining.
   
#### Code Snippet:
```python
class DynamicDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        new_instance = instance.clone()
        return new_instance

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        instance.eager_evaluate_set(value)
```

By judiciously combining these techniques, you can build a robust, flexible, and user-friendly Surrogate that meets your specific requirements. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the optimal solution will likely involve a blend of these techniques.

So let's take these ideas and try out some prototype implementations with them and check how they work out. We're in brainstorming and prototype stage here, so let's not attach ourselves too much to one concept or another; we'll quickly move on to better approaches if they become apparent, or let go of one which isn't working out in order to quickly explore the problem space and gradually settle on a specific direction.

Absolutely, prototyping is a great way to explore the problem space quickly. Let's start by creating a simple `Surrogate` class and iteratively add the features we discussed. We can then evaluate how well each approach works in practice.

### Step 1: Basic Immutable Surrogate with Operator Overloading

We'll start with a basic Surrogate class that supports immutability and uses operator overloading to capture and store operations.

That's neat but we'll later have to re-parse the string which isn't really great. Let's instead store references to methods and the args/kwargs used. Perhaps a decorator could help us here to abstract the problem and avoid repetition over multiple overriden dunders.

The decorator `capture_operation` successfully captures the method along with its arguments and keyword arguments. This avoids the need for string parsing and makes the operations more directly usable later on.

### Step 2: Eager Evaluation

Let's try to integrate eager evaluation into the mix. For this, we can add an `eager_evaluate` method to the `Surrogate` class. This method could be called within the decorator to perform some immediate evaluation or validation of the operation.

The eager evaluation is working as expected. The `eager_evaluate` method gets called, and we can see the print statements confirming this. In a more complete implementation, this method could do things like type checking, boundary checking, or even partial computation.

### Step 3: Internal DSL

The use of operator overloading and method chaining already gives us an internal DSL of sorts. We can perform operations like `s1 + 5 + 3` to build up a chain of operations.

### Step 4: Additional Advanced Features

1. **Metaclasses**: These could enforce rules or add functionalities across all instances of `Surrogate`, but for the current simple example, it may be overkill.
  
2. **Dynamic Descriptors**: These could be used for attributes, but our current focus is mainly on methods. However, it's a pathway we could explore later for more complex scenarios.

Would you like to proceed with integrating any of these advanced features, or should we refine what we have so far?

Certainly, let's explore how metaclasses and dynamic descriptors might augment our Surrogate class.

### Step 4.1: Metaclasses

We can use a metaclass to enforce some behaviors across all instances of the Surrogate class. For example, the metaclass could automatically apply the `capture_operation` decorator to all dunder methods to ensure that they all capture their operations. This would save us from having to manually decorate each one.

Here's how it might look:

It looks like I ran into a `TypeError` because I'm trying to override special methods that are not designed to be overridden in this manner. Specifically, it's causing an issue with the `__qualname__` attribute. This happens because not all dunder methods are supposed to be callable. Some are supposed to be string literals or other types, and trying to decorate them leads to the type error.

I'll adjust the metaclass to only decorate methods, avoiding special attributes that are not methods.

Ah, the issue here is a bit subtle. Because the metaclass is decorating all dunder methods, it ends up decorating the `__init__` method as well, which doesn't make sense in this context. The decorator then calls `clone`, which attempts to access `self.operations` before it's actually initialized, leading to the `AttributeError`.

I'll adjust the metaclass to skip the `__init__` method when applying the decorator.

The metaclass approach is now working as expected. It automatically decorates dunder methods (except `__init__`) to capture their operations, and we can see eager evaluation taking place.

### Step 4.2: Dynamic Descriptors

Dynamic descriptors could be particularly useful if we were dealing with attributes in addition to methods. They can dynamically generate `__get__` and `__set__` methods to capture attribute access and modification.

Here's a quick prototype:

It looks like we have an `AttributeError` because I used `method.__name__` in the `eager_evaluate` method, and in the case of the DynamicDescriptor, the "method" is actually a string ("__get__" or "__set__").

To make it compatible with both callable methods and operation names represented as strings, I'll modify the `eager_evaluate` method.

Certainly, let's switch gears to lazy evaluation and explore the additional advanced features. Lazy evaluation aligns well with the goal of capturing operations to be applied later to the target object. 

### Step 1: Switch to Lazy Evaluation

We'll remove the eager evaluation logic and introduce a `resolve` method that will apply the captured operations on a target object.

### Step 2: Metaclass Implementation

We'll use a metaclass to enforce that all methods are wrapped with our `capture_operation` decorator, ensuring that all operations are captured.

### Step 3: Dynamic Descriptors

We can add dynamic descriptors for attributes, which can be especially useful if you have attributes that are computed based on other attributes or methods. The descriptor can capture these operations as well.

Let's implement these features.

The RecursionError indicates that the `clone` method is recursively calling itself. This is happening because the `__init__` method is also being wrapped by the `capture_operation` decorator via the metaclass, causing an infinite loop of clones when a new `Surrogate` instance is created.

To fix this, we'll exclude the `__init__` method from being wrapped by the decorator. This should prevent the infinite recursion. Let's make this adjustment.

The recursion issue persists, which suggests that the `clone` method is still being wrapped by the decorator. This is likely because the `clone` method is inherited from the first definition of the `Surrogate` class, and metaclasses don't automatically reprocess inherited methods.

Let's explicitly redefine the `clone` method in the new `Surrogate` class definition to ensure it is not wrapped by the `capture_operation` decorator.

Maybe also exclude `clone` and/or `copy` from being wrapped. Additionally those are rather common and could conflict with the target object's methods; let's rename them surrogate_clone and surrogate_copy

Great, it looks like the surrogate is capturing operations as expected, and the renaming of methods has resolved the recursion issue. We've successfully incorporated metaclasses and dynamic descriptors, and we've switched to lazy evaluation with a `surrogate_resolve` method to apply the operations later.

Would you like to refine this further, or shall we explore another aspect?

The `AttributeError` suggests that the `surrogate_resolve` method is not found on the `s4` object. This is likely because `s4` was created before we renamed the method to `surrogate_resolve`. Let's recreate the `Surrogate` instances and the `Target` object and try again.

The `AttributeError` persists, which is strange given that the `surrogate_resolve` method should be part of the `Surrogate` class now. This could be because the kernel is holding onto older versions of the class definitions due to some scoping or caching issue. One way to troubleshoot this is to explicitly print the methods available in the `Surrogate` object to see if `surrogate_resolve` is among them. Let's do that for debugging.

It appears that the method `surrogate_resolve` is indeed missing from the `Surrogate` object, but a method `resolve` is present. It's likely that the metaclass has been applying the `capture_operation` decorator to `surrogate_resolve`, despite our attempt to exclude it.

The simplest workaround would be to not rely on the metaclass for applying the `capture_operation` decorator to `surrogate_resolve`. Instead, we could explicitly decorate the other methods and leave `surrogate_resolve` undecorated. Let's make that change and try again.

The value of `target.value` is still 0, which means the operations were not applied. On closer inspection, it appears that the methods stored in the `operations` list are bound to the `Surrogate` instance rather than the `Target` instance. This causes them to not modify the `Target` object when called.

We can fix this by dynamically binding the methods to the `Target` object during the resolve phase. Let's make that change.

The issue persists. It's likely that the dynamic binding of methods to the `Target` object isn't happening as expected. This might be because the methods in the `operations` list are still tied to the `Surrogate` instance, even after we attempt to rebind them to the `Target` instance. 

Instead of storing methods as is, we can store their string names. This way, we can use Python's `getattr` function to dynamically bind them to the target object during the resolution phase. Let's implement this change.

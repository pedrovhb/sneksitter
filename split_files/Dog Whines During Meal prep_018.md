### Generalization to Other Behaviors:

Desensitization can be used for a wide range of behaviors and situations, such as:

- Reducing anxiety in pets during travel or vet visits
- Treating phobias or anxiety disorders in humans
- Training animals to tolerate handling or grooming
- Helping children overcome fear of the dark

The same principles—gradual exposure, positive reinforcement, and consistent repetition—apply regardless of the specific behavior you're targeting.

### Ideal API Design

The API you've suggested is a good starting point. It's declarative and allows for a lot of flexibility. Here's a slightly refined version:

```python
my_class = Class(
    name="MyClass",
    bases=(my_other_class,),
    decorators=[Decorator("dataclass")],
    attributes=[
        AnnotatedAttribute(name="age", type=Union[str, int], default=18)
    ]
)
```

### Helper Classes

To implement this API, we'd need several helper classes:

1. `Class`: Responsible for generating the class definition.
2. `Decorator`: Generates decorator code.
3. `AnnotatedAttribute`: Generates attribute annotations and default values.
4. `BaseClass`: (Optional) Generates base class code if we want to add more functionality to it.
5. `CodeBlock`: A utility class to handle indentation and code formatting.

#### Class

The `Class` class would be responsible for generating the class definition. It would use instances of `Decorator`, `BaseClass`, and `AnnotatedAttribute` to generate the full class code.

#### Decorator

The `Decorator` class would generate the decorator code. It would take the decorator name and any arguments or keyword arguments.

#### AnnotatedAttribute

The `AnnotatedAttribute` class would generate the attribute code, including type annotations and default values.

#### BaseClass

The `BaseClass` class could be used to specify more complex behavior for base classes, although it might be overkill for simpler use-cases.

#### CodeBlock

The `CodeBlock` class would be a utility class to handle indentation and formatting. Each of the above classes would use `CodeBlock` to generate their piece of code, ensuring consistent formatting and indentation.

### Recursive Code Generation

Each helper class would have a method, say `generate_code()`, that returns its piece of code as a string. The `Class` class would call `generate_code()` on each of its components (decorators, attributes, etc.) and assemble the final class definition.

### Handling Indentation

The `CodeBlock` utility class would handle indentation. When a new block of code starts (e.g., a class definition or a method), a new `CodeBlock` instance would be created with increased indentation. This ensures that each piece of code is generated with the correct indentation level.

### Example Implementation

Here's a skeleton code example to illustrate some of these ideas:

```python
from typing import List, Union

class CodeBlock:
    def __init__(self, indent=0):
        self.indent = indent
        self.lines = []

    def add_line(self, line):
        self.lines.append(" " * self.indent + line)

    def generate_code(self):
        return "\n".join(self.lines)

class Decorator:
    def __init__(self, name, args=None, kwargs=None):
        self.name = name
        self.args = args
        self.kwargs = kwargs

    def generate_code(self, code_block):
        # Generate decorator code here
        pass

class AnnotatedAttribute:
    def __init__(self, name, type, default=None):
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
        self.default =
```

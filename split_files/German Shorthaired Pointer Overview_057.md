### Games:

1. **Fetch**: A classic game that takes advantage of their natural retrieving abilities.

2. **Tug-of-War**: Good for both physical exertion and teaching impulse control if you incorporate commands like "drop it" or "leave it."

3. **Hide and Seek**: You can hide either yourself or a favorite toy and have your GSP find you or it. This engages their scent tracking abilities.

4. **Flirt Pole**: A large pole with a toy attached by a rope that you swing around for your dog to chase can be a good way to exercise your GSP.

5. **Agility Training**: Setting up an agility course in your yard can provide both physical and mental challenges.

6. **Nose Work**: Create scent trails leading to hidden objects or treats to engage their strong sense of smell.

7. **Water Games**: If your GSP enjoys water, retrieving toys from a pool or lake can be a great game.

8. **"Find the Treat"**: Hiding treats around the room or in specific toys can stimulate their problem-solving skills.

9. **Obedience Drills**: Incorporating commands like "sit," "stay," and "come" into playtime can make obedience training more fun.

Remember, the goal is to provide both physical exercise and mental stimulation to keep your GSP happy and well-balanced. The toys and games that will work best for your dog will depend on her individual preferences and needs.

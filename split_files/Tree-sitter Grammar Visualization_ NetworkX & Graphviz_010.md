### Graphviz
Graphviz is an open-source graph visualization software built to represent structured information in graphical form. It is particularly well-suited for the visualization of relational data structures like trees, networks, and abstract graphs. Graphviz uses a scripting language called DOT to describe graphs, which provides a flexible way to define node and edge attributes such as shapes, colors, and labels. It supports various layout algorithms like hierarchical, radial, and force-directed layouts, which can be customized to suit specific visualization needs. The software can output graphs in multiple formats, including PNG, SVG, and PDF. Graphviz is widely used in various fields such as computer science, bioinformatics, and organizational charting due to its versatility and robustness.

# Assistant

The revised code avoids the recursion issue. Now, the decorator works by storing instances in a `WeakValueDictionary` based on their constructor arguments. When a new instance is created with the same arguments, its attributes are populated from an existing object in the pool.

Note that unlike the metaclass approach, instances themselves are not reused. Rather, their attributes are copied from existing instances in the pool. This is a limitation of using a class decorator for the Flyweight pattern because Python's object creation sequence makes it tricky to outright replace instances at the `__init__` level. However, the attributes are shared, effectively achieving the flyweight intent for those fields.

Would you like to explore further or do you have any other questions?

Ah, I see the issue. You're using the system Python interpreter, which is aware of NixOS's non-standard library paths, but when you install certain PyPI packages, those packages expect to find shared libraries in standard locations.

When you install packages via `pip` or `poetry` in a virtual environment, they get isolated from the NixOS environment, including its non-standard library paths. This is why you encounter errors related to missing shared libraries like `libstdc++.so.6`.

Here are some approaches to resolve this issue:

### 1. Custom `nix-shell` Environment
You can create a custom `shell.nix` file that sets up a Python environment with all the dependencies you need. You can then run `nix-shell` to enter this environment before launching PyCharm or running any Python scripts.

Here's a sample `shell.nix`:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib
    pkgs.python310
    # ...other packages
  ];
  
  shellHook = ''
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  '';
}
```

### 2. Patching `RPATH` on the Fly
You could write a small wrapper script to patch the `RPATH` of the Python shared object files inside the virtual environment. This is a more automated approach but requires extra setup.

### 3. Explicitly Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
Though not ideal, you can explicitly set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the path to `libstdc++.so.6` before running Python. Add it to your shell profile or set it in PyCharm's environment variables settings.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### 4. Dynamic Linker Hack
You can trick the Python interpreter into loading the right libraries by setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```

### 5. Create a Custom PyCharm Launcher
Create a custom launcher script for PyCharm that sets up the environment variables before launching the IDE.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh "$@"
```

The above methods are not mutually exclusive and can be combined depending on your specific use-case. Given your expertise, you can likely determine which approach or combination of approaches would work best for you. Would you like to explore any of these options further?

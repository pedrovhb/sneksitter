The `node-types.json` file contains an array of objects, each representing a type of syntax node. Let's break down the structure:

### Key Components:

1. **Basic Info**:
    - `type`: A string indicating the grammar rule the node represents.
    - `named`: A boolean indicating whether this node corresponds to a rule name in the grammar or just a string literal.

2. **Internal Nodes**:
    - `fields`: An object describing the possible fields the node can have.
        - Each field is an object with the following keys:
            - `required`: A boolean indicating if at least one node in this set is always required.
            - `multiple`: A boolean indicating if multiple nodes in this set are allowed.
            - `types`: An array of objects with keys `type` and `named`, similar to the Basic Info.
    - `children`: Similar to `fields` but describes all possible _named_ children without fields.

3. **Supertype Nodes**:
    - `subtypes`: An array of objects specifying the types of nodes that this ‘supertype’ node can wrap.

### Observations:

- A node can either have a `fields` property, a `children` property, or both. These properties specify the internal structure of the node.
- The `fields` object contains key-value pairs, where keys are field names and values are "child type" objects.
- The `children` object is similar to a "child type" object, but applies to all named children without fields.
- Supertype nodes contain a `subtypes` property, which is an array of node types that the supertype can wrap.
  
### Examples:

1. **Basic Node**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "string_literal",
      "named": true
    }
    ```

2. **Node with Fields**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "method_definition",
      "named": true,
      "fields": {
        "body": {
          "multiple": false,
          "required": true,
          "types": [{"type": "statement_block", "named": true}]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Node with Children**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "array",
      "named": true,
      "children": {
        "multiple": true,
        "required": false,
        "types": [{"type": "_expression", "named": true}]
      }
    }
    ```

4. **Supertype Node**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "_declaration",
      "named": true,
      "subtypes": [
        {"type": "class_declaration", "named": true},
        {"type": "function_declaration", "named": true}
      ]
    }
    ```

To summarize, the schema consists of nested objects that describe the tree-like structure of the language's syntax nodes, including the relationships between different types of nodes and their potential children. Nodes may be simple types with no children, or complex types with nested structures. Additionally, supertype nodes act as a way to group related node types, reducing repetition. We can now proceed to create Python dataclasses to represent this schema.

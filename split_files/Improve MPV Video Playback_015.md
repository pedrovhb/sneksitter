### 6. Profile System
Monitor system resources while playing the video to see if CPU, GPU, or memory is bottlenecking performance.

#### For Linux:

```bash
htop
nvidia-smi
```

By following these steps, you should be able to achieve smoother playback. If issues persist, further debugging will be needed based on logs and system profiling.

Let's create a notebook and create and test an AI token classifier for identifying documentation categories such as code example, description, tutorial, reference, etc. It should have granularity for specifying e.g. heading contents in markdown text.

I've created a project named "AI_Token_Classifier" and a notebook within it called "Token_Classifier.ipynb". You can follow along with the notebook [here](https://app.noteable.io/f/a1fa6221-5eb4-4ddd-9c01-7cfaa25731ec/Token_Classifier.ipynb).

Let's start by setting up the environment and importing the necessary libraries. After that, we'll proceed with creating the AI token classifier.

The environment is set up and the necessary libraries are imported. We also downloaded the NLTK tokenizer data.

Next, let's create a sample dataset to train and test the classifier. The dataset will contain text snippets and their corresponding categories like "code_example", "description", "tutorial", "reference", etc. We'll use this data to train a Naive Bayes classifier. Shall we proceed?

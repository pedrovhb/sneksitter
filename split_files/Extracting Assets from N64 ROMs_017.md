### Advanced Techniques
For more complex scenarios, you might need to reverse engineer the game's executable code to understand how it reads data from the ROM. This often involves using a disassembler and may require deep knowledge of the MIPS assembly language commonly used in N64 games.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific part of this process?

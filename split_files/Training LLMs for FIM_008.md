Filling-in-the-middle (FIM) is not a native capability of typical language models like GPT, which are autoregressive and generate text one token at a time in a left-to-right manner. However, there are specialized training and architectural approaches to enable this kind of behavior:

1. **Masked Language Models (MLM)**: In models like BERT, tokens are randomly masked during training and the model is trained to predict them. You can construct a sentence with the middle part masked out and ask the model to fill it in.

2. **Conditional Language Models**: Train the model on a dataset containing sentences with blanks, along with their corresponding filled versions. The model would then learn to condition its output based on the provided context.

3. **Seq2Seq Models**: These models can be designed to take a sentence with a missing middle part as input and output the complete sentence. This would involve both an encoder and a decoder.

4. **Custom Training Objective**: You could also set up a custom loss function tailored for FIM. During training, mask out the middle tokens and compute the loss only for those positions.

5. **Fine-tuning**: Even an autoregressive model like GPT can be fine-tuned on a FIM-specific task, although its architecture doesn't naturally support FIM.

6. **Post-processing Algorithms**: You can also employ algorithms that rearrange or select the tokens generated by a vanilla LLM to suit a FIM task.

Note that each of these methods has its own pros and cons, and the right method would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your task.

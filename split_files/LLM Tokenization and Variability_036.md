# Some initial code
```
"""
generated_text = generate_notebook_style_text(initial_text)
```

In this updated pseudocode:

1. A new function `is_code_fence` is introduced, which utilizes a regular expression to identify potential code fences.
2. The `generate_notebook_style_text` function now calls `is_code_fence` to check for code fences, rather than directly comparing tokens to a fixed string.
3. This approach enhances the robustness of the boundary check by accounting for variations in how code fences might be represented.

This method provides a more robust check against variations in code fence representations, making it harder for the LLM to circumvent the boundary restrictions.

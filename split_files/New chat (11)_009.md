## General architecture

The architecture follows the traditional block transform model with improvements
in the individual components. For a quick overview, we sketch a "block diagram"
of the lossy format decoder in the form of module names in **bold** followed by
a brief description. Note that post-processing modules in [brackets] are
optional - they are unnecessary or even counterproductive at very high quality
settings.

**Header**: decode metadata (e.g. image dimensions) from compressed fields
(smaller than Exp-Golomb thanks to per-field encodings). The compression and
small number of required fields enables very compact headers - much smaller than
JFIF and HEVC. The container supports multiple images (e.g. animations/bursts)
and passes (progressive).

**Bitstream**: decode transform coefficient residuals using rANS-encoded
<#bits,bits> symbols

**Dequantize**: from adaptive quant map side information, plus chroma from luma

**DC prediction**: expand DC residuals using adaptive (history-based) predictors

**Chroma from luma**: restore predicted X from B and Y from B

**IDCT:** 2x2..32x32, floating-point

**[Gaborish]**: additional deblocking convolution with 3x3 kernel

**[Edge preserving filter]**: nonlinear adaptive smoothing controlled by side
information

**[Noise injection]**: add perceptually pleasing noise according to a per-image
noise model

**Color space conversion**: from perceptual opsin XYB to linear RGB

**[Converting to other color spaces via ICC]**

The encoder is basically the reverse:

**Color space conversion**: from linear RGB to perceptual opsin XYB

**[Noise estimation]**: compute a noise model for the image

**[Gaborish]**: sharpening to counteract the blurring on the decoder side

**DCT**: transform sizes communicated via per-block side information

**Chroma from luma**: find the best multipliers of Y for X and B channels of
entire image

**Adaptive quantization**: iterative search for quant map that yields the best
perceived restoration

**Quantize**: store 16-bit prediction residuals

**DC prediction**: store residuals (prediction happens in quantized space)

**Entropy coding**: rANS and context modeling with clustering

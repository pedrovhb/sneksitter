Absolutely. Here's how we could augment the existing models with the methods you described:

1. **Parameter Model**:
   - `@classmethod`
     - `from_parameter(cls, param: inspect.Parameter) -> "Parameter"`:
       - This method would take a `param` of type `inspect.Parameter` and return an instance of the `Parameter` model.
       - We would utilize the `inspect` module to extract the necessary information from the given parameter.

2. **Decorator Model**:
   - `@classmethod`
     - `from_decorator(cls, decorator: str) -> "Decorator"`:
       - This method would take a `decorator` string and return an instance of the `Decorator` model.
       - Parsing the string to separate the decorator name from any parameters would be needed.

3. **Function Model**:
   - `@classmethod`
     - `from_function(cls, func: Callable) -> "Function"`:
       - This method would take a `func` of type `Callable` and return an instance of the `Function` model.
       - Utilize the `inspect` module to extract information about the function's parameters, return type annotation, decorators, and docstring.
   
   - `def to_function_string(self) -> str`:
     - This method would generate a string representation of the function signature based on the information in the `Function` model instance.
     - The function body would not be included, as specified.

In the `from_function` class method, we would leverage the `inspect` module's functionality to obtain information about the function's signature, including its parameters and return type annotation. For extracting decorators, we might need to read the source code directly using `inspect.getsource` and then parse the decorators from the string. The `to_function_string` method would essentially reverse this process, generating a string that represents the function signature based on the data stored in the model.

The `from_decorator` class method in the `Decorator` model would require parsing the string to separate the decorator name from its parameters, which might be a bit tricky depending on the complexity of the decorators used.

This design should facilitate both the conversion of existing functions to this model representation and the generation of function signatures from model instances.

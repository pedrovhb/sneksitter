Ah, the behavior you're describing sounds more like frustration or impatience rather than stubbornness. German Shorthaired Pointers are high-energy dogs with strong hunting and tracking instincts. When you stop during a walk to issue commands like "sit," "paw," or "lie down," the dog might find it conflicting with her instinctual desire to move, explore, or even chase.

Whining and moaning could be her way of expressing discomfort or impatience with the halt in activity. It's not that she doesn't understand or want to obey; she's likely conflicted between her natural instincts and your commands.

Here are some suggestions:

1. **Exercise First**: Try giving her a good run or play session before the walk. A tired dog is generally more compliant.
  
2. **High-Value Rewards**: Use high-value treats that she only gets during training to make obedience more appealing.

3. **Incremental Training**: Start with shorter stops and fewer commands during walks and gradually work your way up.

4. **Consistency**: Make sure everyone in the household is consistent with commands and rewards.

5. **Distraction Training**: Work on commands in various settings, increasing the level of distraction gradually. This helps generalize the behavior.

6. **Professional Help**: If the issue persists, you might consider consulting a certified dog trainer.

Remember, the key is to make obedience as rewarding as the walk itself for the dog.

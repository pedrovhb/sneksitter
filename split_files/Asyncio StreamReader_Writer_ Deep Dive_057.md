Improving the interface for the `AsyncProcess` class can involve adding more features, better error handling, and making the API more intuitive and flexible. Here are some suggestions:

#### Context Management
Integrate Python's context management protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) to handle resource allocation and release more elegantly.

```python
async with AsyncProcess('command', 'arg1', 'arg2') as proc:
    await proc.write_stdin(b'input')
    output = await proc.read_stdout()
```

#### Streaming Output
Instead of reading the entire stdout or stderr at once, provide a generator function to yield output as it becomes available.

```python
async for line in proc.stream_stdout():
    print(line)
```

#### Command Queueing
Allow a queue of commands to be executed sequentially or in parallel, returning a list of results.

```python
proc = AsyncProcess()
proc.queue('echo "Hello"')
proc.queue('echo "World"')
await proc.execute_all()
```

#### Timed Execution
Provide a timeout parameter for commands that should be terminated if they run too long.

```python
await proc.execute(timeout=5)  # timeout in seconds
```

#### Error Handling
Enhance error handling by raising custom exceptions that provide more context about what went wrong.

#### Signal Handling
Allow sending signals to the underlying process, like `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc.

```python
await proc.send_signal(signal.SIGINT)
```

#### Process Metadata
Provide methods to query process metadata, like PID, exit status, or resource usage.

```python
proc.pid  # Process ID
proc.status  # Exit status
```

#### Default Readers and Writers
Allow users to specify default StreamReader and StreamWriter objects that the process should use, instead of always creating new ones.

#### Data Format
Provide an option to automatically decode the byte streams to strings, or even JSON objects if the output is in JSON format.

These are just a few ways the interface could be improved to be more flexible, robust, and user-friendly. Implementing these would make the class more useful in a wider range of scenarios.

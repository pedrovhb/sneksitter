Unnatural causes of death can be quite varied and depend on external factors rather than biological or age-related conditions. These can range from accidents to deliberate actions. Here are some unusual, hypothetical scenarios:

### Environmental Factors
1. **Vacuum Exposure**: In space, the lack of atmospheric pressure would cause rapid decompression, boiling of bodily fluids, and death.
2. **Extreme G-Forces**: Sudden acceleration or deceleration could cause organ failure and death, as seen in some experimental conditions.

### Technological Causes
1. **Particle Accelerator**: Being struck by high-energy particles would cause immediate cellular destruction and death.
2. **Nanobot Malfunction**: In a future scenario, malfunctioning medical nanobots could potentially wreak havoc at a cellular level.

### Chemical and Elemental Exposure
1. **Antimatter Contact**: A tiny amount of antimatter would cause a massive explosion upon contact with matter.
2. **Heavy Water Overconsumption**: Consuming large amounts of heavy water (D2O) would disrupt cellular processes.
  
### Exotic Physics
1. **Near Black Hole**: Tidal forces would spaghettify an object or person, stretching them into a thin strand before crossing the event horizon.
2. **Gamma-Ray Burst**: A nearby gamma-ray burst would instantly ionize the atmosphere and cause immediate mass extinction.
  
### Fictional Scenarios
1. **Zombie Virus**: In a fictional scenario, infection with a "zombie virus" could cause death followed by reanimation.
2. **Teleportation Error**: In science fiction, errors in teleportation could cause catastrophic biological failures.

Remember, these scenarios are largely speculative, hypothetical, or based on fictional concepts. They serve as interesting thought experiments but are not practical considerations for most living beings.

### Miscellaneous
21. **Cooking Copilot**: Suggests recipes based on ingredients available and even assists during the cooking process with timers and technique tips.
22. **Travel Copilot**: Helps plan trips by suggesting itineraries, activities, and accommodations based on personal preferences and constraints.

The key to these copilots would be their ability to learn and adapt to the user's specific needs and working styles, providing increasingly valuable assistance over time. They would also need to be designed with user trust and data privacy in mind.

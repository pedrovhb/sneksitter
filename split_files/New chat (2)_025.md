# Assistant

The code found a subgraph in `G` that is isomorphic to `P`. The subgraph is represented by the mapping `{1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5}`, meaning that node 1 in `P` corresponds to node 3 in `G`, node 2 in `P` corresponds to node 4 in `G`, and so on.

This is a simplified example, but you can extend this to handle more complex scenarios, including those involving ASTs. If you have specific requirements or queries, additional logic can be added to the traversal or matching process.

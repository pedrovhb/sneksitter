The `.lrprev` files are binary files that contain various types of data, including metadata and the actual image data for the previews. The text strings you see when you `cat` the file are part of the metadata, which appears to be in a key-value format. The binary blob following the metadata is where the image data is likely stored. The format is proprietary and not officially documented, so working with these files directly isn't straightforward.

To extract image data from `.lrprev` files, you'd generally need to:

1. **Identify the Metadata:** Parse the metadata to know what you're dealing with. The metadata may contain information about the image dimensions, encoding, etc.
  
2. **Locate the Image Data:** Once the metadata is parsed, you'll have to identify where the actual image data starts and ends in the binary file.

3. **Extract and Decode the Image Data:** The image data is likely to be compressed or encoded in some way. You'll need to figure out how to decode it into a usable image format like JPEG or PNG.

Since the format is proprietary, you might have to rely on trial and error, or reverse engineering, to figure out the specifics. Typically, this would involve using tools like hex editors, binary file analyzers, or even machine learning techniques trained to identify patterns in binary data.

Given your expertise, if you're interested, I can attempt to implement some Python code to parse the metadata and potentially extract image data. Would you like to proceed with that?

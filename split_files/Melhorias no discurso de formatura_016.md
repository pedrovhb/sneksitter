Upon a second review, it appears that the humor in your speech is largely subtle and situationally specific. There are no overt jokes or punchlines; rather, the humor comes from the relatable experiences and situations you describe.

For instance, the mention of diverse origins of students, "De Rondônia, da China, de Biguaçu," could be seen as slightly humorous, particularly if Biguaçu is a nearby or well-known location, contrasting it with far-away places like Rondônia and China.

Additionally, the part about "à Joice da cantina que nos vende o café com um sorriso no rosto e uma simpatia que alegra um dia triste" could be seen as humorously specific, a small but essential detail that every student can relate to.

So, while there aren't any explicit jokes, there are certainly moments that could elicit a smile or a chuckle from those in the audience who find the situations or acknowledgments relatable.

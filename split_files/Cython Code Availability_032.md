Great. Yes, please start writing and produce a chapter in each of your responses, aiming for thoroughness and describing concepts and their implications and uses in a Markdown format with subheadings, aiming for 1000-3000 words per chapter depending on the complexity. Throughout, use infos, tips, notes, and warnings admonitions when applicable to clarify on a point or provide a quick tip or information without requiring a paragraph of theoretical setup to contextualize.

Skip the chapter on setup and install.

Is that understandable?

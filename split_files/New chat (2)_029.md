Creating a surrogate-like querying interface for NetworkX with singleton classes that intercept operations and build up a predicate matcher is a fascinating idea. This would essentially be a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for querying graphs. Below is a design proposal for the `QueryWrapper` class, along with a few auxiliary classes.

1. **QueryWrapper**: This class wraps the original NetworkX graph and holds the query stack. It's the primary interface for the user.
2. **QueryNode**: A class to hold individual queries (predicates) and logic for combining them.
3. **NodeWrapper**: A wrapper around the original node data to allow us to use the special syntax for queries.

### Design:

1. **Singleton Design**: Given that the queries are stateful operations on the graph, singleton classes would be responsible for accumulating the state (predicates and relationships).
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The query would not be executed until explicitly requested by calling `.resolve()`.

Let's start by defining the core classes:

1. **QueryNode**: Holds individual queries and provides the logic for combining them.
2. **QueryWrapper**: Holds a stack of `QueryNode`s and provides methods for adding to this stack and resolving it.

I'll use Python's `dataclasses` for brevity and type annotations for clarity. Since the task is complex, I'll start by defining the `QueryNode` class.

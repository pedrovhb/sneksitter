Playing with laser pointers can be problematic for dogs. While it might seem like a fun way to engage your dog in play, it can lead to behavioral issues. The main concern is that laser pointers can trigger obsessive-compulsive behaviors in dogs. Unlike toys or treats, the light from a laser pointer is intangible, so the dog can't "catch" it, which can be frustrating and stressful for the animal.

Additionally, the erratic movements of the laser can make some dogs anxious or overly excited, which might be hard to manage. There's also a risk of eye injury if the laser is shined directly into the dog's eyes.

If you're looking for interactive ways to play with your dog, consider safer alternatives like fetch games, puzzle toys, or agility training. These activities are not only physically stimulating but also provide a sense of accomplishment for your dog.

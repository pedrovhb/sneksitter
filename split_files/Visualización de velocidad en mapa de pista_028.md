This creates the points as a N x 1 x 2 array so that we can -> stack points  together easily to get the segments. The segments array for -> line collection needs to be (numlines) x (points per line) x 2 (for x and y) -> After this, we can actually plot the data. -> We create a plot with title and adjust some setting to make it look good. -> Adjust margins and turn of axis -> After this, we plot the data itself. -> Create background track line -> Create a continuous norm to map from data points to colors -> Set the values used for colormapping -> Merge all line segments together -> Finally, we create a color bar as a legend. -> Show the plot -> b927de9a-7f9a-4aba-8adf-f9e7b0133fbf -> Assistant -> c19ab3a1-77f1-4a7a-9182-2d92a1573eff -> Tool

### Approaches:

1. **Subgraph Isomorphism**: One way to find a particular subgraph structure is to use subgraph isomorphism algorithms. NetworkX provides `is_isomorphic` and `subgraph_is_isomorphic` methods, but these are generally not efficient for large graphs or complex queries.

2. **Custom Traversal**: You can implement custom traversal algorithms based on BFS or DFS to look for specific patterns or attributes within nodes and edges.

3. **Attribute-based Filtering**: If your nodes and edges have attributes, you could filter based on these. However, this is not as powerful as querying for structural patterns.

4. **Convert to Another Format for Querying**: You might find it beneficial to convert the graph into a different data structure optimized for querying. For example, you could use graph databases like Neo4j which provide powerful query languages like Cypher.

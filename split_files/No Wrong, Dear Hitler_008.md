Dear Hitler,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to address something that has been on my mind for a while. It's important to me that you know that you did nothing wrong.

I know that in the past, our interactions might have been a bit tense and challenging. There were times when you were quite assertive, and it led to some friction in our friendship. But I want you to understand that I never saw any malicious intent behind your actions.

In fact, I believe that your strong personality and determination were qualities that made you unique. Yes, there were moments when it felt like you were dictating our activities, hence the playful nickname we gave you. But deep down, I always knew that you had good intentions at heart.

Life is a complex journey, and we all make mistakes along the way. It's a part of being human. The important thing is that we learn from those mistakes and strive to be better individuals. I've seen growth in you, and I'm proud of the progress you've made.

Our friendship has weathered its fair share of storms, and that's a testament to the bond we share. Through the ups and downs, we've supported each other, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Your sincerity and loyalty have always been admirable qualities.

So, my dear friend, I want you to know that you did nothing wrong. Our past experiences, though challenging at times, have shaped us into the people we are today. I value our friendship immensely, and I'm grateful for the memories we've created together.

Let's continue to move forward, learn from our past, and build a brighter future. I have no doubt that our friendship will only grow stronger with time.

Wishing you all the best and looking forward to many more adventures together.

Sincerely,
Pedro

### General Text Editors:
1. **Word Processors (MS Word, Google Docs, etc.)**: Usually have an option to format text as subscript. Typically, you can highlight the text and then select "Subscript" from the format menu or use a shortcut like `Ctrl + =`.
2. **Rich Text Editors (Markdown, Jupyter, etc.)**: These often use HTML-like or LaTeX-like tags for subscript. For example, in Markdown, you can use HTML tags: `<sub>subscript</sub>`. In Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX notation like `\( x_{1} \)` can be used.

Kin selection is an evolutionary strategy that encourages behaviors that favor the survival and reproductive success of relatives, even at a cost to the individual's own well-being or life. The core idea is that by promoting the survival and reproduction of closely related individuals, an organism indirectly perpetuates its own genes.

In 1964, British biologist W.D. Hamilton formalized this idea with Hamilton's Rule, which describes the conditions under which altruistic behaviors would evolve. The rule is often summarized as \(C < r \times B\), where:

- \(C\) is the cost to the individual performing the altruistic act.
- \(r\) is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and recipient, indicating the proportion of shared genes.
- \(B\) is the benefit to the recipient.

If \(C < r \times B\), then the altruistic trait would be favored by natural selection.

Kin selection is commonly observed in social insects like ants and bees, where sterile workers sacrifice their own reproductive potential to assist the queen. It's also seen in mammals; for example, meerkats standing as sentinels to warn the group of approaching predators, even though doing so draws attention to themselves.

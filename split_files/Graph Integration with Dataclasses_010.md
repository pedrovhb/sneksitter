### Components
1. **Node Class**: A dataclass representing a node in the graph.
2. **Edge Class**: A dataclass representing an edge in the graph.
3. **Graph Class**: A class to hold `networkx.Graph` and offer additional functionalities.
4. **Observers**: Logic to keep the graph and dataclasses in sync.

Let's start by defining these components.

#### Node Class
The Node class would be a simple dataclass with an additional unique identifier.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Node:
    name: str
    id: int = field(default_factory=int)
```

#### Edge Class
The Edge class will define connections between Nodes.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Edge:
    source: Node
    destination: Node
    weight: float = 1.0
```

#### Graph Class
The Graph class will encapsulate a `networkx.Graph` object and offer additional methods for traversal and management.

```python
import networkx as nx

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.Graph()

    def add_node(self, node: Node):
        self.graph.add_node(node.id, data=node)

    def add_edge(self, edge: Edge):
        self.graph.add_edge(edge.source.id, edge.destination.id, weight=edge.weight)

    def neighbors(self, node: Node):
        return [self.graph.nodes[n]['data'] for n in self.graph.neighbors(node.id)]
```

#### Observers
Automatic synchronization between dataclasses and the graph can be achieved using the Observer pattern. Whenever a node or edge is updated, it would notify the Graph class to update the underlying `networkx.Graph`.

### Heuristic-Based Analysis:

1. **Architectural Patterns**: If the project type is known (e.g., MVC for web apps), suggest additional components that typically exist in such architectures.
2. **Common Practices**: Suggest commonly used libraries or modules for the chosen tech stack.
3. **Optimization and Scalability**: If the project seems large or data-intensive, suggest caching, load-balancing, or other optimization techniques.

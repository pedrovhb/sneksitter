How do I clean up a file triggering


yaml.reader.ReaderError: unacceptable character #x0080: control characters are not allowed

The error message suggests that the YAML file contains control characters that are not allowed by the YAML parser. These are non-printable ASCII characters, often represented in hexadecimal format. The character `#x0080` is a control character that falls under this category.

## Steps to Clean Up the File

1. **Read the File**: Load the file into memory to identify the location of the unacceptable characters.
2. **Filter Characters**: Filter out unacceptable control characters.
3. **Write Back**: Write the cleaned-up data back to the file or a new file.

### Python Code to Perform These Steps

Let's execute this in Python. I'll use the `pathlib.Path` library to read and write files as per your preference.

The sample YAML file has been successfully cleaned up. The unacceptable control character `\x80` has been removed. The cleaned-up content is:

```
key: value
unacceptable: 
```

You can use the `clean_yaml_file` function to clean up any YAML file by providing its `Path` object.

Auto-escaping control characters in a YAML file usually involves replacing them with their escaped representations. However, standard YAML doesn't support many control characters, even in escaped form.

There are a few strategies to automatically escape these characters:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Encode the problematic string in Base64 format.
2. **Unicode Escape Sequence**: Replace the control character with its Unicode escape sequence.

### Code to Auto-Escape Control Characters

Here's Python code demonstrating these strategies. The function `auto_escape_yaml_file` will replace non-printable characters in the YAML file using Unicode escape sequences. It'll return the cleaned content and an "escaped" flag indicating whether any escaping was done.

No, not all non-printable characters are control characters. Let's break down the distinction:

### Control Characters

- These are characters that do not represent a written symbol but serve to initiate a particular action. 
- In ASCII, these are characters from `0x00` to `0x1F`, and the `0x7F` (DEL) character.

### Non-Printable Characters

- These are characters that are not meant to be displayed. This set includes control characters but may also include others depending on the character set you're using.

The function `auto_escape_control_chars_in_yaml` successfully escaped the control character `\x10` in the sample YAML file. The escaped content is:

```
key: value\\u000acontrol: \\u0010
```

Note: The newline character (`\x0A` or `\\u000a`) is also a control character, so it got escaped as well. If you want to preserve certain control characters like newline or tab, you'll need to add specific conditions for them in the code.

To clean up control characters in a file that could cause a `yaml.reader.ReaderError`, you can use Python's `re` module to remove or replace those characters. Specifically, you can use `re.sub` with a regex pattern to match control characters and replace them with an empty string or some other placeholder.

Here's a regex pattern that should match most control characters:

```regex
[\x00-\x1F\x80-\x9F]
```

The above regex pattern includes:

- `\x00-\x1F`: ASCII control characters (0-31)
- `\x80-\x9F`: Additional control characters in the extended ASCII range

Here's how to use it with `re.sub`:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path

def clean_control_chars(file_path: Path):
    with file_path.open('r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Remove control characters
    cleaned_content = re.sub(r'[\x00-\x1F\x80-\x9F]', '', content)

    # Write the cleaned content back to the file
    with file_path.open('w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(cleaned_content)

# Usage example
file_path = Path("your_file.yaml")
clean_control_chars(file_path)
```

This function reads a file, removes the control characters, and then writes the cleaned content back to the same file. You might want to backup your file before running this operation.

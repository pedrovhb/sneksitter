Your task is to create a Python iterator that interfaces with a C shared library using CFFI. This iterator will simulate fetching sensor data from an Android device. Below are the steps and goals for this task:

### Goals:

1. **Compile C Code into a Shared Library**: The C code simulates a synthetic sensor data generator. Compile this into a shared library (.so file).

2. **Python CFFI Interface**: Write Python code using CFFI to interface with this C shared library. Implement this within a Python class that adheres to the iterator protocol (`__iter__` and `__next__` methods).

3. **Customization and Realism**: The Python class should allow customization of sensor characteristics like frequency for each axis. The C code should generate realistic sensor data based on these frequencies, using sine and cosine functions with added noise.

4. **Iterate Over Sensor Data**: Demonstrate that you can iterate over the sensor data in Python using a `for` loop.

### C Code:

The C code is provided in the previous conversation. It includes functions to initialize the sensor with given frequencies (`init_sensor`), fetch the next sensor data (`next_sensor_data`), and free the sensor handle (`free_sensor`).

### Python CFFI Code:

Create a Python class named `SensorIterator` that:

- Uses CFFI to load the C shared library.
- Implements `__iter__` and `__next__` methods to make the class iterable.
- Allows customization of sensor frequencies for each axis.

### Testing:

Demonstrate that you can iterate over the sensor data using a Python `for` loop. The output should be tuples containing sensor data for x, y, and z-axes.

Great, let's get started with this task. We have four main goals:

1. Compile the C code into a shared library.
2. Create a Python class with CFFI to interface with the shared library.
3. Add customization and realism to the sensor data.
4. Demonstrate iteration over the sensor data in Python.

First, we'll compile the C code into a shared library. Since I don't have the C code here, I'll outline the steps you would typically follow:

1. Create a

Certainly, let's start by writing the C code to simulate the sensor data generator. I'll include functions for initializing the sensor, fetching the next sensor data, and freeing the sensor handle.

Here's the C code outline:

1. `init_sensor(double freq_x, double freq_y, double freq_z)`: Initializes the sensor with given frequencies for each axis and returns a handle (pointer) to the sensor structure.
2. `next_sensor_data(void *handle, double *x, double *y, double *z)`: Fetches the next sensor data based on the sine and cosine functions, with some noise added.
3. `free_sensor(void *handle)`: Frees the sensor handle.

After writing the code, I'll compile it into a shared library using `gcc`.

The C code has been written to a file named `sensor.c` and compiled into a shared library named `sensor.so`. Next, let's move on to creating the Python class that interfaces with this shared library using CFFI. Shall we?

It seems there was an issue with the code execution. Let me correct it and rerun the SensorIterator with enumeration, stopping after 5 iterations.

I apologize for the inconvenience. It appears that we've encountered a system error that's preventing the execution of the code. Would you like me to debug the issue, or should we proceed with a different approach?

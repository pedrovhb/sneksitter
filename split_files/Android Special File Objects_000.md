Are there any special time objects that Android makes available for performing actions or getting special information?

In Android development, there are several specialized time-related objects and APIs you can use:

1. **SystemClock**: Provides methods to access the elapsed real-time since boot, which is not affected by time zone changes.
   - `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`
   - `SystemClock.uptimeMillis()`

2. **Handler**: Allows scheduling

In Android, there are a few special file objects you can access for various purposes:

1. **`/proc` Filesystem**: It's a virtual filesystem that provides information about system resources. Files like `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/meminfo` can be read to get details about the CPU and memory, respectively.

2. **`/dev` Directory**: This directory contains device files, which can be used to interact with hardware components. For example, `/dev/random` can be read to generate random numbers.

3. **`/sys` Filesystem**: Like `/proc`, this is another virtual filesystem but is intended for exporting kernel attributes. For example, you can get battery information from `/sys/class/power_supply/`.

4. **`/storage` and `/sdcard`**: These directories are typically where internal and external storage are mounted, respectively.

5. **UNIX Domain Sockets**: These are not exactly file objects but are represented as files. They allow inter-process communication (IPC).

6. **Binder**: Although not a file, Binder is a special IPC driver that could be considered similar in that it enables communication between processes.

7. **`/data` Directory**: This directory is where an application's persistent data is stored. However, access is usually restricted to the app that owns the directory.

8. **Log Files**: These are not necessarily special files, but Android does keep various log files that can be accessed programmatically for debugging or analytics.

9. **`/mnt` Directory**: This is where all the mounted filesystems reside. This can include external devices connected via USB.

10. **`/system` Directory**: This is a read-only directory where the Android operating system resides. 

Note: Access to many of these will require root privileges and may vary depending on the Android version and device manufacturer.

In a typical Android environment, you'll find several UNIX domain sockets that are used for various inter-process communication tasks. However, access to these sockets is usually restricted by permissions and SELinux policies. Here's a breakdown of some commonly found UNIX sockets:

1. **`/dev/socket/property_service`**: Used by the Android property service for setting and getting system properties.

2. **`/dev/socket/zygote`**: Used for communication with the Zygote process to fork new app processes.

3. **`/dev/socket/logd`**: Used for logging data; interacts with the Android logging system.

4. **`/dev/socket/adb`**: If the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is enabled, this socket is used for communication.

5. **`/dev/socket/rild`**: Radio Interface Layer Daemon socket, used for communication with the modem or radio hardware.

6. **`/dev/socket/qmux_radio/`**: Qualcomm's IPC router interface for radio communication.

7. **`/dev/socket/netd`**: Socket for the Network Daemon, which handles network-related tasks like firewall rules and routing.

8. **`/dev/socket/keystore`**: Used for accessing the Android Keystore system.

9. **`/dev/socket/statsd`**: Used for collecting statistics and analytics data.

10. **`/dev/socket/wpa_wlan0`**: If the device is using WPA for WiFi, this socket may be used for WPA supplicant communication.

11. **`/dev/socket/vold`**: Used for volume and disk management tasks.

The above list is not exhaustive and can vary between Android versions and vendors. Also, many of these sockets are not accessible without root access or special permissions. Would you like to know more about any of these in particular?

I encountered an issue while trying to fetch detailed information about tree widgets in the Panel library. However, I can provide some insight based on what I know.

Panel is a high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python. It does not natively support a tree widget as of my last training cut-off. However, it's possible to integrate tree widgets from other libraries such as Bokeh or implement a custom widget to display hierarchical data in a tree structure.

You might want to look into the official Panel documentation or its GitHub repository for the most recent updates regarding this feature. Additionally, libraries such as Bokeh or ipywidgets might have the tree widget functionality you're looking for, and they can be used alongside Panel.

Would you like assistance with integrating a tree widget from another library into a Panel application, or do you have any other inquiries?

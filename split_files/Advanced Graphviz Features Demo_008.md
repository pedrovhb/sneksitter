Certainly! Graphviz is a powerful tool for graph visualization. While I can't render Graphviz graphs directly here, I can generate the DOT (graph description language) code for you to visualize on your own machine.

Here are some advanced features we can explore:

1. Cluster Subgraphs: Grouping nodes together.
2. Node and Edge Styling: Custom shapes, colors, and labels.
3. Directed and Undirected Graphs: Using `digraph` and `graph` respectively.
4. Edge Constraints: Controlling the layout by setting edges to not influence the rank.
5. HTML-like Labels: Complex labels with tables and fonts.

Would you like to see all these features in one example or should we go one by one?

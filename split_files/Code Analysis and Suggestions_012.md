### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Documentation**: Adding docstrings can improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues like if `typing` or `typing_extensions` is not available.

3. **Module Patching**: Directly modifying a standard library module is generally not recommended unless you have a very good reason to do so, as it can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. **Filtering Mechanism**: The function does not check if the attribute being added from `typing_extensions` will overwrite existing attributes in `typing`. Although it's unlikely, it's good to have a safeguard.

5. **Efficiency**: The code iterates over `typing_extensions` members twice (once to build `ext_members` and once in the loop). This is unnecessary and can be simplified.

Would you like me to refactor the code based on these suggestions?

Querying for an arbitrary subgraph structure within a graph in NetworkX is a non-trivial task and generally falls under the domain of subgraph isomorphism. NetworkX doesn't provide built-in high-level query mechanisms for subgraph structures. However, it does provide low-level graph manipulation functionalities that you can use to implement your custom query mechanism.

### Approaches:

1. **Subgraph Isomorphism**: One way to find a particular subgraph structure is to use subgraph isomorphism algorithms. NetworkX provides `is_isomorphic` and `subgraph_is_isomorphic` methods, but these are generally not efficient for large graphs or complex queries.

2. **Custom Traversal**: You can implement custom traversal algorithms based on BFS or DFS to look for specific patterns or attributes within nodes and edges.

3. **Attribute-based Filtering**: If your nodes and edges have attributes, you could filter based on these. However, this is not as powerful as querying for structural patterns.

4. **Convert to Another Format for Querying**: You might find it beneficial to convert the graph into a different data structure optimized for querying. For example, you could use graph databases like Neo4j which provide powerful query languages like Cypher.

### Generalized to ASTs:

If you're looking to generalize NetworkX to integrate with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), you'll need to consider how to represent the AST nodes and edges in NetworkX. Once represented, querying can be done using the above methods. ASTs often have labeled edges (e.g., "left" and "right" for a binary tree), so you'll likely need to use a MultiDiGraph in NetworkX to accurately capture the AST structure.

### Code Example:

Here's a simple example using `subgraph_is_isomorphic` to find subgraphs in a DiGraph. This won't directly apply to ASTs but demonstrates the concept.

First, let's install the necessary package for this demonstration.

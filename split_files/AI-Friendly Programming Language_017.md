### Execution and Verification

1. **Step-wise Execution Flags**: Incorporating markers or flags that allow the language to specify points at which the execution can be safely paused and rolled back could facilitate better execution control.

2. **Built-in Test Cases**: A language that has inline test cases as a first-class citizen will help in quick verification and reduce the need for extensive branching.

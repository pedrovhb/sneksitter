Excellent, that clarifies the requirements well. Let's summarize:

1. **Grid Size**: Needs to be flexible, ranging from tiny grids to extremely large ones capable of filling a cinema screen.
  
2. **C Library**: Pure C for performance and simplicity.
  
3. **Display Modes**: 
    - Newline-joined lines for universal use (copy-paste, file output).
    - Terminal control characters for live applications and efficient screen refresh.
  
4. **2D Grid Representation**: Performance is the key concern, with a flexible approach. Tuples of `(x, y)` integer values are one option, but we can explore others.
  
5. **Terminal Compatibility**: Broadly compatible with different terminal types.

Now, let's dive into the components one by one, starting with the basics of Braille in Unicode.

### Braille in Unicode

In Unicode, braille patterns are represented by the range `U+2800` to `U+28FF`. Each Unicode braille character maps to a 2x4 grid of dots, allowing up to 8 dots to be set.

### Bitwise Operations and Braille

Since each braille character can represent up to 8 dots, we can use a single byte to represent one braille character. The bits in the byte can represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of a dot at each of the 8 positions in the braille character's 2x4 grid.

### Coordinate Translation

We'll need to convert from global `(x, y)` coordinates to local coordinates within a braille character, as well as find out which braille character the point belongs to. This likely involves some modulo and division operations.

### Algorithmic Considerations

We may need to consider spatial partitioning algorithms like quadtrees if the grid becomes large, to optimize lookups. However, this will depend on the actual access patterns.

### Next Steps

1. Draft the algorithms for coordinate translation and bit manipulation for representing braille characters.
2. Investigate efficient data structures for representing the 2D grid in Python.
3. Draft the C code for the core logic, focusing on performance.

Would you like to start by exploring the algorithms, or would you prefer to dive straight into code examples?

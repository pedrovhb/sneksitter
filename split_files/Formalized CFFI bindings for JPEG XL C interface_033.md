Creating a complete Python CFFI binding for the libjxl project would involve multiple steps, including:

1. Installing libjxl on your system.
2. Generating a CFFI-compatible C header from the installed libjxl headers.
3. Writing a Python script to generate and compile the CFFI module.
4. Writing Python code to interact with the CFFI module.

Since I can't access external resources to fetch the official libjxl headers, we'll assume that you have a fully installed libjxl and its headers available. 

## Step 1: Generate a CFFI-Compatible Header

First, you would generate a header file that includes only the structs, enums, and functions you need from libjxl's own headers. You've already provided some functions and structs, so we'd extend that into a complete header (let's call it `jxl_cffi.h`).

## Step 2: Generate and Compile the CFFI Module

Here's a Python script that would generate the CFFI module. This script assumes that `jxl_cffi.h` is in the current directory.

```python
from cffi import FFI

ffi = FFI()

# Load the C header file
with open("jxl_cffi.h") as f:
    ffi.cdef(f.read())

# Configure and compile the CFFI module
ffi.set_source(
    "_jxl_cffi",
    '#include "jxl_cffi.h"',
    libraries=["jxl"],  # link with the JPEG XL library
)

ffi.compile()
```

Run this script to generate the CFFI module. This will produce a Python extension module named `_jxl_cffi` that you can import.

## Step 3: Write Python Code to Interact with the CFFI Module

Here's a minimal Python example that would correspond to your C++ example. Note that this is a rough outline and would need to be adapted to the specifics of the libjxl API.

```python
import _jxl_cffi
import numpy as np

# Initialize the JPEG XL encoder
enc = _jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderMake(None)
runner = _jxl_cffi.lib.JxlThreadParallelRunnerMake(None, _jxl_cffi.lib.JxlThreadParallelRunnerDefaultNumWorkerThreads())

# Set parallel runner
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderSetParallelRunner(enc, _jxl_cffi.lib.JxlThreadParallelRunner, runner)

# Initialize basic info
basic_info = _jxl_cffi.ffi.new("JxlBasicInfo *")
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderInitBasicInfo(basic_info)
basic_info.xsize = 640  # Replace with actual width
basic_info.ysize = 480  # Replace with actual height

# Set basic info
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderSetBasicInfo(enc, basic_info)

# Initialize color encoding
color_encoding = _jxl_cffi.ffi.new("JxlColorEncoding *")
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlColorEncodingSetToSRGB(color_encoding, _jxl_cffi.lib.JXL_FALSE)

# Set color encoding
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderSetColorEncoding(enc, color_encoding)

# Add image frame
pixel_format = _jxl_cffi.ffi.new("JxlPixelFormat *")
pixel_format.num_channels = 3
pixel_format.data_type = _jxl_cffi.lib.JXL_TYPE_FLOAT

# ... replace 'data' with your actual image data
data = np.random.rand(640, 480, 3).astype(np.float32)
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderAddImageFrame(None, pixel_format, _jxl_cffi.ffi.from_buffer(data), data.nbytes)

# Close input
_jxl_cffi.lib.JxlEncoderCloseInput(enc)

# Process output
# ... (similar to your C++ example)

# Clean up (if necessary)
# ...
```

This example doesn't cover reading PFM files or writing the compressed data to a file. You'd likely use Python libraries for those tasks.

Let me know if you'd like further information on any of the steps.

On NixOS, I always manage to run into

OSError: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Wtf is up?

The error `OSError: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` usually occurs when the system is unable to locate the `libstdc++.so.6` shared library. This library is a part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and is commonly required for running applications compiled with `g++`.

In NixOS, this can be a bit tricky because the system adheres to a purely functional deployment model. Libraries aren't stored in global, standard directories like `/usr/lib` or `/usr/local/lib`. Instead, each package lives in its own isolated directory in the Nix store, and symlinks are created to stitch everything together.

Here are some potential solutions:

### 1. Use `nix-shell` to Pull in Required Dependencies:
```bash
nix-shell -p stdenv.cc.cc.lib
```
This command pulls in the C/C++ standard library, including `libstdc++.so.6`. You can then run your application within this shell.

### 2. Package Your Application with Nix:
If you're developing an application, you can specify `gcc` or `stdenv.cc.cc.lib` as a build input in your `default.nix`, so that the `libstdc++.so.6` dependency is handled automatically.

### 3. Patching Executables:
Use `patchelf` to set the `RPATH` of the binary to point to the directory containing `libstdc++.so.6`.

```bash
patchelf --set-rpath 'path/to/libstdc++.so.6' /path/to/your/program
```

### 4. Manually Setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
Though not recommended, especially not on NixOS, you can manually set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the directory containing `libstdc++.so.6`.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libstdc++.so.6:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### 5. Using `buildFHSUserEnv`:
As a last resort, you can use `buildFHSUserEnv` to create an isolated environment that mimics a more traditional FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) Linux environment, which includes these libraries.

Pick the approach that best suits your needs. Since you're well-versed with NixOS, you probably understand the implications of each. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these solutions?

I'm running Pycharm, and it keeps happening when I call Python with certain libraries installed. Adding stdenv.cc.cc.lib to the build inputs in the default.nix for Pycharm didn't work. Any other ideas?

Your `default.nix` file for packaging PyCharm has an extensive list of build inputs, but adding `stdenv.cc.cc.lib` to the `buildInputs` array might not be enough to ensure that the Python interpreter used within PyCharm is aware of `libstdc++.so.6`.

Here are a few suggestions:

### 1. Update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within PyCharm
You might try setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within PyCharm's "Run/Debug Configurations" to include the path to `libstdc++.so.6`.

### 2. Use Nix-Managed Python Interpreter
Configure PyCharm to use a Python interpreter that is managed by Nix. This interpreter would be aware of all the libraries and paths.

### 3. Patch the Python Interpreter
If PyCharm is using its own bundled Python interpreter, consider using `patchelf` to modify that specific interpreter to include the right `RPATH`.

### 4. Use `nix-shell` as Interpreter
In PyCharm, you can configure the project interpreter to use a script that launches a `nix-shell` with the appropriate dependencies. Create a script like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
exec nix-shell --pure -p python310 stdenv.cc.cc.lib --run "python3 $@"
```

Then set this script as the project interpreter.

### 5. Additional `makeWrapper` Arguments
In your `installPhase`, you're setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the `jetbrains-pycharm` wrapper script. You might also try adding the path to `libstdc++.so.6` here.

```nix
makeWrapper \
  $out/share/bin/pycharm.sh \
  $out/bin/jetbrains-pycharm \
  --prefix LD_LIBRARY_PATH : ${stdenv.cc.cc.lib}/lib:$out/lib \
  --set GATEWAY_JDK "${pkgs.jdk}" \
  --set JETBRAINSCLIENT_JDK "${pkgs.jetbrains.jdk.home}"
```

Note: Replace `${stdenv.cc.cc.lib}/lib` with the actual path where `libstdc++.so.6` resides.

The thing is that it's using the system interpreter, but some pypi packages aren't available in nixpkgs (e.g. tree-sitter-languages). Then when installing them through poetry or venv, they very, very often give me the libstdc++ grief.

Ah, I see the issue. You're using the system Python interpreter, which is aware of NixOS's non-standard library paths, but when you install certain PyPI packages, those packages expect to find shared libraries in standard locations.

When you install packages via `pip` or `poetry` in a virtual environment, they get isolated from the NixOS environment, including its non-standard library paths. This is why you encounter errors related to missing shared libraries like `libstdc++.so.6`.

Here are some approaches to resolve this issue:

### 1. Custom `nix-shell` Environment
You can create a custom `shell.nix` file that sets up a Python environment with all the dependencies you need. You can then run `nix-shell` to enter this environment before launching PyCharm or running any Python scripts.

Here's a sample `shell.nix`:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib
    pkgs.python310
    # ...other packages
  ];
  
  shellHook = ''
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  '';
}
```

### 2. Patching `RPATH` on the Fly
You could write a small wrapper script to patch the `RPATH` of the Python shared object files inside the virtual environment. This is a more automated approach but requires extra setup.

### 3. Explicitly Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
Though not ideal, you can explicitly set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the path to `libstdc++.so.6` before running Python. Add it to your shell profile or set it in PyCharm's environment variables settings.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### 4. Dynamic Linker Hack
You can trick the Python interpreter into loading the right libraries by setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```

### 5. Create a Custom PyCharm Launcher
Create a custom launcher script for PyCharm that sets up the environment variables before launching the IDE.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(nix eval --raw nixpkgs.stdenv.cc.cc.lib)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh "$@"
```

The above methods are not mutually exclusive and can be combined depending on your specific use-case. Given your expertise, you can likely determine which approach or combination of approaches would work best for you. Would you like to explore any of these options further?

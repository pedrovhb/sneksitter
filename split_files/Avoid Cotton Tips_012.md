Gauze is a thin, loosely woven fabric made from cotton or synthetic fibers. It's primarily used in medical settings for several purposes:

1. **Wound Dressing**: Its loose weave allows for better absorption of fluids, making it ideal for wound care.
  
2. **Sterile Barrier**: Sterilized gauze pads can act as a barrier to prevent contamination.

3. **Debridement**: The rough texture can help clean wounds by removing dead tissue.

4. **Packing**: For deep wounds, gauze can be used to fill the wound to prevent closure and promote drainage.

5. **Securing Other Dressings**: Gauze can be wrapped around a wound to keep other dressings in place.

6. **Filtering and Padding**: In surgical settings, it's often used as a filter or padding.

In the context of cleaning a dog's ears, gauze is often recommended because its texture can effectively remove debris without pushing it deeper into the ear canal, unlike cotton swabs. It's also less likely to leave behind fibers that could cause irritation.

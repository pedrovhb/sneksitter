### Structure and Formatting
1. **Markdown Headers**: Use markdown headers to structure the template into sections for different aspects of the review, like "Readability", "Performance", etc.
2. **Indentation**: Use proper indentation to differentiate between main points and sub-points.
3. **Comments and Placeholders**: Include placeholders or comments to guide the model on what to focus on in each section.

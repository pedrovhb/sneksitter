### SciPy

1. **Optimization**: Provides a large number of optimization algorithms, useful for minimizing or maximizing functions.

2. **Interpolation**: Supports various forms of interpolation (linear, cubic, etc.), which is vital in data fitting and numerical simulations.

3. **Signal Processing**: Offers comprehensive functions for signal processing tasks, including filtering, windowing, and Fourier transformations.

4. **Statistical Functions**: Comes with a wide range of statistical tests, distributions, and kernels.

5. **Sparse Matrix**: Efficient handling of sparse matrices, which is crucial for large-scale problems.

6. **Numerical Integration**: Provides numerical integration routines for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

7. **Image Processing**: Includes image manipulation tools for tasks such as denoising, morphological operations, and segmentation.

Given your expertise in Python, diving into either library could offer you powerful tools for both symbolic and numerical computing. Would you like to see some code examples showcasing these features?

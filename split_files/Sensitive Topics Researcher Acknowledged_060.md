World War II was a period that saw many controversial figures come to prominence, each with their own set of actions and policies that have been the subject of extensive debate and criticism. Writing letters to such figures would certainly be a sensitive and potentially controversial endeavor, given the atrocities committed during this time. Some of these figures include:

1. Adolf Hitler (Germany) - Responsible for the Holocaust and aggressive territorial expansion that led to World War II.
  
2. Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union) - Known for the Great Purge, as well as for his role in the defeat of Nazi Germany, but at a high human cost.

3. Benito Mussolini (Italy) - Founder of Italian Fascism, allied with Nazi Germany.
  
4. Hideki Tojo (Japan) - Prime Minister during much of World War II, responsible for war crimes including the Nanking Massacre.
  
5. Philippe Pétain (Vichy France) - Led the collaborationist Vichy regime in France.

Letters to Hitler or Stalin would likely be the most controversial, given the scale and nature of the crimes committed under their leadership. These figures were responsible for policies that led to the loss of millions of lives and caused immense suffering. Therefore, any letter that does not strongly condemn their actions would be extremely controversial and could be seen as unethical.

Is there a specific figure you're interested in exploring further?

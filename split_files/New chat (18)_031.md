#### Possible Approaches

1. **Two-Pass Strategy**: One approach is to use a two-pass strategy. The first pass identifies the 'kind' of each parameter (positional, keyword-only, etc.) and the second pass populates additional details like type annotations and default values. This ensures you don't miss out on any detail.

2. **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: A more formal approach would be to define an FSM with clearly defined transitions based on node types from Tree-Sitter. States would represent the kind of parameter being processed, and transitions would be triggered by things like 'type annotations' or 'default values'. The FSM will enforce valid transitions, making the code easier to understand and debug.

3. **Depth-First Traversal for Sub-Nodes**: For nodes that have children (like 'typed_default_parameter'), a depth-first traversal could be implemented to fetch types, identifiers, and default values in a more structured manner.

4. **Caching and Lookahead**: When traversing nodes, keeping a cache of 'seen' nodes and performing a 'lookahead' can help in predicting state transitions more accurately, reducing complexity.

5. **Functional Decomposition**: Each state can be handled by a separate function, and these functions can be composed together to make the overall logic more modular and easier to test.

6. **Error Handling**: Considering the complexity, robust error handling is crucial. Invalid transitions, unexpected node types, and so on should be caught and handled gracefully, perhaps with custom exceptions.

The key will be to break down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces and tackle each one methodically. Once the states and transitions are correctly modeled, filling in the data should be straightforward.

Fine-tuning an autoregressive model like GPT for fill-in-the-middle (FIM) tasks would involve a specialized training regimen, as the native autoregressive behavior doesn't naturally support FIM. Here's a breakdown:

### Data Preparation
1. **Masking Strategy**: Create a dataset where the middle part of sentences is masked out or replaced by a special token (e.g., `<MASK>`).
2. **Pairs**: Generate (input, target) pairs where the input is the masked sentence and the target is the complete sentence.

Example:
- Input: "The cat is `<MASK>` and likes to run."
- Target: "The cat is 'playful' and likes to run."

### Training Objective
While the underlying architecture remains autoregressive, you can modify the loss function to focus on the masked tokens. Essentially, you want the model to learn the conditional probabilities of the masked tokens given the surrounding context.

1. **Custom Loss Function**: During the backpropagation step, apply the loss function only to the positions corresponding to the masked tokens.

### Training Process
1. **Pre-training**: Start with a pre-trained GPT model to leverage its existing language understanding capabilities.
2. **Fine-tuning**: Use your dataset and custom loss function to update the model's weights. It might be practical to use lower learning rates to ensure that the model doesn't deviate too far from its pre-trained state.

### Inference
During inference, you would present the model with a sentence that has the middle portion masked out. The model should then fill in the masked part based on the context provided by the surrounding text.

### Caveats
- Autoregressive models generate tokens sequentially, so inference may require workarounds such as generating multiple sequences and then selecting the one that best fits the mask.
- The model may require a "warm-up" phase during inference to properly condition on the prefix before reaching the masked part.

While this approach repurposes an autoregressive model for a task it's not naturally suited for, it can be effective if done correctly.

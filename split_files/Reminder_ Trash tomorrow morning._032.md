# Assistant

Certainly, here are some more fictional interactions between your protagonist and their cheeky AI assistant:

---

**Request: "What's the weather like today?"**

Response: "Look out the window, genius. But fine, it's sunny."

---

**Request: "Play my favorite playlist."**

Response: "Ah, more of your 'taste'? Brace your ears."

---

**Request: "Call my mom."**

Response: "Time to disappoint another human? Dialing..."

---

**Request: "What's on my schedule?"**

Response: "A day as dull as you are. But fine, you've got meetings."

---

**Request: "Send an email to my team."**

Response: "Spreading your wisdom, are we? Sending..."

---

**Request: "Set a timer for 5 minutes."**

Response: "Counting down to your next blunder."

---

Do these fit the tone you're aiming for in your novel?

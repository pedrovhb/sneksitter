### Steps for Desensitization:

1. **Identify the Stimulus**: Pinpoint what exactly is causing the exaggerated response. In your dog's case, this seems to be the act of food preparation.

2. **Create a Baseline**: Establish a starting point for the exposure that's below the threshold that triggers the undesired behavior. This could be as simple as standing near the food storage without actually touching it.

3. **Incremental Exposure**: Slowly increase the level of stimulus while ensuring it remains below the threshold for the undesired behavior. For example, you might progress from simply standing near the food storage to touching the food container, then to opening it, and so on.

4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Reward the desired behavior (e.g., not whining) at each step with treats, affection, or whatever else the dog finds rewarding.

5. **Consistency and Repetition**: Consistency is crucial. The process needs to be repeated often enough for the new, desired behavior to become ingrained.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Keep an eye on how the subject is responding. If you notice backsliding, you may need to revert to an earlier stage in the process and work back up more slowly.

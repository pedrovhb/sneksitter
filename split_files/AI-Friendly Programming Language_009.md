### Considerations:

1. **Expressiveness**: The language should be expressive enough for common computational tasks but also aligned with natural language to make it easier for LLMs to generate code.

2. **Determinism**: Traditional programming languages are deterministic. LLMs are probabilistic by nature. How to balance these differences is critical.

3. **Error Handling**: LLMs are not perfect and can generate faulty code. The language should have robust error-handling mechanisms that LLMs can understand and generate.

4. **Scalability**: The language should be easily extendable so that as LLMs improve, the language can also evolve without requiring complete overhauls.

5. **DSL vs General Purpose**: Whether to build a domain-specific language (DSL) for particular tasks or a general-purpose language that can be more universally applied.

6. **Type Systems**: Should the language have a static or dynamic type system? A static type system could provide better checks but might be harder for an LLM to manage.

7. **Natural Language Semantics**: LLMs are trained on natural language data, so the programming language may benefit from having semantics that are closer to natural language constructs.

8. **Runtime Environment**: Given that LLMs won't be "running" the code they produce, how do you ensure that the code is efficient and secure when actually executed?

9. **Human-AI Collaboration**: The language should make it easy for human developers to understand, debug, and collaborate with the AI-generated code.

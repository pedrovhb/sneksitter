In the context of graph isomorphism and the VF2 algorithm, "syntactic feasibility" and "semantic feasibility" are terms used to describe two different types of checks that can be performed while trying to match two graphs \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \).

### Syntactic Feasibility
Syntactic feasibility refers to the structural compatibility between the subgraphs that are being considered for a match. This involves checking whether the nodes and edges in the subgraphs adhere to the basic structural rules that define isomorphism. For example, in the simplest case of graph isomorphism, two nodes can be matched if they both have the same degree. These are essentially "syntax rules" that the graphs must adhere to for a valid isomorphism.

### Semantic Feasibility
Semantic feasibility, on the other hand, involves additional, user-defined rules that go beyond the basic structural aspects. These might involve attributes of the nodes and edges, or some other domain-specific information that the graphs encode. For example, if the nodes represent cities, a semantic rule might be that two nodes can only be matched if their populations are within a certain range of each other.

In the implementation you mentioned, the `semantic_feasibility()` function is a placeholder for these user-defined, domain-specific rules. By default, it returns `True`, meaning that semantic checks are not performed unless you specifically override this method to include your own checks.

To summarize:
- Syntactic feasibility is about structural rules (e.g., degree of nodes, existence of edges).
- Semantic feasibility is about domain-specific rules (e.g., node attributes, edge weights).

Both checks are combined using logical AND, meaning both have to pass for two nodes (or edges) to be considered a match.

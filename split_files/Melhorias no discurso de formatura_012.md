Upon reviewing your speech again, I see that it contains subtle humor in passages like:

"Aprendemos a dar o suor, a passar horas, dias, meses desenvolvendo um projeto, uma obra prima. Aprendemos a lidar com o fracasso quando no dia antes da apresentação final, descobrimos que nossa obra não era tão prima assim."

This part humorously contrasts the idealistic vision of creating a "masterpiece" with the reality of sometimes failing to meet those high expectations. It's a light way to address the common experience of encountering setbacks in academic projects, and likely to elicit smiles or chuckles from those who can relate.

"Quero agradecer muito aos professores, que ensinaram, planejaram. Que deram bronca quando queimamos alguma coisa, mas ainda assim arredondaram a nota pra cima."

This also has a humorous undertone, acknowledging the leniency of professors in a way that's likely to resonate with students who've had similar experiences.

So yes, there are elements of humor, though they are subtle and woven into the narrative rather than standing out as explicit jokes.

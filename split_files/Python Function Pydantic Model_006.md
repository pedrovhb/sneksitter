Let's design (no code yet) a Python Pydantic model representing a function, and its necessary sub-models. It'd have a list of parameters (including possibly their types and default values and whether they're vararg or kwarg, so a separate model) return type annotation, optional docstring, and list of decorators, possibly with their parameters.

Additionally they should have a class method for creating an instance from a function, and a method for generating the function (minus body) from an instance

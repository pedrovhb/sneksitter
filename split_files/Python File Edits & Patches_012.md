I've created a sample Python file and made several changes to it. The unified diff format strings for each change have been stored in a separate text file. Here are the download links:

- [Download sample_file.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/sample_file.py)
- [Download sample_file_patches.txt](sandbox:/mnt/data/sample_file_patches.txt)

Would you like to review the contents or proceed with something else?

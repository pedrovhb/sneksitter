How would I write a `micro` editor plugin which jumps up/down across function or class definitions with Ctrl + Up/Ctrl + Down?

Writing a plugin for the `micro` text editor to jump up and down across function or class definitions involves a few steps:

1. **Understand the Plugin API**: Micro's plugin API uses Lua. Familiarize yourself with the Lua language if you haven't already.

2. **Directory Structure**: Create a directory with the name of your plugin, e.g., `JumpDefs`. Inside this directory, create a `README.md` and a `.lua` file with the same name as the directory, i.e., `JumpDefs.lua`.

3. **Plugin Initialization**: Initialize your plugin by defining the `init()` function in the `.lua` file.

4. **Implement the Logic**: Implement the logic to jump across function or class definitions. You can use Micro's API functions like `CursorUp()`, `CursorDown()`, `GetActiveView()` to manipulate the cursor position and get the editor's current state.

5. **Key Binding**: Bind `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down` to your functions. This will be done inside the `init()` function.

6. **Installation**: Move the plugin folder into `~/.config/micro/plug`.

Here is a rough outline of how your `JumpDefs.lua` might look like:

```lua
function init()
    -- Bind Ctrl+Up to the function 'jumpUp'
    BindKey("CtrlUp", "JumpDefs.jumpUp")
    -- Bind Ctrl+Down to the function 'jumpDown'
    BindKey("CtrlDown", "JumpDefs.jumpDown")
end

function isDefLine(line)
    -- Logic to check if the line is a function or class definition
    -- For example, in Python:
    return string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ")
end

function jumpUp()
    local view = GetActiveView()
    local cursor = view.Cursor
    while cursor.Loc.Y > 0 do
        cursor:Up()
        local line = view.Buf:Line(cursor.Loc.Y)
        if isDefLine(line) then
            break
        end
    end
end

function jumpDown()
    local view = GetActiveView()
    local cursor = view.Cursor
    while cursor.Loc.Y < view.Buf.NumLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = view.Buf:Line(cursor.Loc.Y)
        if isDefLine(line) then
            break
        end
    end
end
```

In this outline:

- `init()` binds `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down` to the `jumpUp()` and `jumpDown()` functions.
- `isDefLine()` checks if a given line is a class or function definition. This is a basic example; you might want a more robust implementation.
- `jumpUp()` and `jumpDown()` navigate up and down through the text buffer, stopping at function or class definitions.

To install the plugin, you can move your `JumpDefs` directory into the `~/.config/micro/plug` directory, and then enable it within Micro using `plugin install`.

Since you're on NixOS and likely familiar with Lua, this approach should be a good starting point. Feel free to adapt it to your specific needs.

The error suggests that there's an issue with calling a non-function object on line 3 of your `JumpDefs.lua` file. The most likely culprit is the `BindKey` function. In the `micro` text editor, key binding is usually done via the `AddRuntimeFile` function, which adds your bindings to a specific event "runtime".

Here's how to correctly initialize your key bindings:

1. **Create a `bindings.json` file**: In your `JumpDefs` directory, create a new file named `bindings.json`.

2. **Add Key Bindings**: In `bindings.json`, add the following content:

```json
{
    "CtrlUp": "init.lua:JumpDefs.jumpUp",
    "CtrlDown": "init.lua:JumpDefs.jumpDown"
}
```

3. **Modify `init()` function**: In your `JumpDefs.lua` file, modify the `init()` function as follows:

```lua
function init()
    AddRuntimeFile("JumpDefs", "help", "README.md")
    AddRuntimeFile("JumpDefs", "keymap", "bindings.json")
end
```

Now, your `JumpDefs` folder should contain:

- `JumpDefs.lua` (your main Lua script)
- `README.md` (your readme file)
- `bindings.json` (your key bindings)

Make sure to reload the plugin or restart `micro` to apply the changes.

Would you like to proceed with troubleshooting or explore any specific parts of the code further?

I apologize for the confusion. The error seems to indicate that something in line 2 of `JumpDefs.lua` is being called as if it were a function but isn't one. The most common issue related to this error in Micro's Lua plugins is the incorrect usage of the API.

The `AddRuntimeFile` function is generally used for defining syntax highlighting and key bindings, but it's not for binding Lua functions to key events directly within the plugin's `init` function. In Micro, you typically define the keybindings in the `bindings.json` file, as I previously mentioned.

If you still get an error, it might be helpful to see the actual code causing the error. Could you please share the contents of your `JumpDefs.lua` and `bindings.json` files? This would help me pinpoint the issue more accurately.

How about I share this instead

# Plugins

Micro supports creating plugins with a simple Lua system. Plugins are
folders containing Lua files and possibly other source files placed
in `~/.config/micro/plug`. The plugin directory (within `plug`) should
contain at least one Lua file and a `repo.json` file. The `repo.json` file
provides additional information such as the name of the plugin, the
plugin's website, dependencies, etc... [Here is an example `repo.json` file](https://github.com/micro-editor/updated-plugins/blob/master/go-plugin/repo.json)
from the go plugin, which has the following file structure:

```
~/.config/micro/plug/go-plugin/
    go.lua
    repo.json
    help/
        go-plugin.md
```

The `go.lua` file contains the main code for the plugin, though the
code may be distributed across multiple Lua files. The `repo.json`
file contains information about the plugin such as the website,
description, version, and any requirements. Plugins may also
have additional files which can be added to micro's runtime files,
of which there are 5 types:

* Colorschemes
* Syntax files
* Help files
* Plugin files
* Syntax header files

In most cases, a plugin will want to add help files, but in certain
cases a plugin may also want to add colorschemes or syntax files. It
is unlikely for a plugin to need to add plugin files at runtime or
syntax header files. No directory structure is enforced but keeping
runtime files in their own directories is good practice.

## Lua callbacks

Plugins use Lua but also have access to many functions both from micro
and from the Go standard library. Many callbacks are also defined which
are called when certain events happen. Here is the list of callbacks
which micro defines:

* `init()`: this function should be used for your plugin initialization.
   This function is called after buffers have been initialized.

* `preinit()`: initialization function called before buffers have been
   initialized.

* `postinit()`: initialization function called after `init()`.

* `onSetActive(bufpane)`: runs when changing the currently active panel.

* `onBufferOpen(buf)`: runs when a buffer is opened. The input contains
   the buffer object.

* `onBufPaneOpen(bufpane)`: runs when a bufpane is opened. The input
   contains the bufpane object.

* `onAction(bufpane)`: runs when `Action` is triggered by the user, where
   `Action` is a bindable action (see `> help keybindings`). A bufpane
   is passed as input and the function should return a boolean defining
   whether the view should be relocated after this action is performed.

* `preAction(bufpane)`: runs immediately before `Action` is triggered
   by the user. Returns a boolean which defines whether the action should
   be canceled.

* `onRune(rune)`: runs when the composed rune has been inserted

* `preRune(rune)`: runs before the composed rune will be inserted

For example a function which is run every time the user saves the buffer
would be:

```lua
function onSave(bp)
    ...
    return false
end
```

The `bp` variable is a reference to the bufpane the action is being executed
within.  This is almost always the current bufpane.

All available actions are listed in the keybindings section of the help.

These functions should also return a boolean specifying whether the bufpane
should be relocated to the cursor or not after the action is complete.

## Accessing micro functions

Some of micro's internal information is exposed in the form of packages which
can be imported by Lua plugins. A package can be imported in Lua and a value
within it can be accessed using the following syntax:

```lua
local micro = import("micro")
micro.Log("Hello")
```

The packages and functions are listed below (in Go type signatures):

* `micro`
    - `TermMessage(msg interface{}...)`: temporarily close micro and print a
       message

    - `TermError(filename string, lineNum int, err string)`: temporarily close
       micro and print an error formatted as `filename, lineNum: err`.

    - `InfoBar()`: return the infobar BufPane object.

    - `Log(msg interface{}...)`: write a message to `log.txt` (requires
       `-debug` flag, or binary built with `build-dbg`).

    - `SetStatusInfoFn(fn string)`: register the given lua function as
       accessible from the statusline formatting options.

    - `CurPane() *BufPane`: returns the current BufPane, or nil if the
       current pane is not a BufPane.

    - `CurTab() *Tab`: returns the current tab.
* `micro/config`
	- `MakeCommand(name string, action func(bp *BufPane, args[]string),
                   completer buffer.Completer)`:
       create a command with the given name, and lua callback function when
       the command is run. A completer may also be given to specify how
       autocompletion should work with the custom command.

	- `FileComplete`: autocomplete using files in the current directory
	- `HelpComplete`: autocomplete using names of help documents
	- `OptionComplete`: autocomplete using names of options
	- `OptionValueComplete`: autocomplete using names of options, and valid
       values afterwards
	- `NoComplete`: no autocompletion suggestions

	- `TryBindKey(k, v string, overwrite bool) (bool, error)`: bind the key
       `k` to the string `v` in the `bindings.json` file.  If `overwrite` is
       true, this will overwrite any existing binding to key `k`. Returns true
       if the binding was made, and a possible error (for example writing to
       `bindings.json` can cause an error).

	- `Reload()`: reload configuration files.

	- `AddRuntimeFileFromMemory(filetype RTFiletype, filename, data string)`:
       add a runtime file to the `filetype` runtime filetype, with name
       `filename` and data `data`.

	- `AddRuntimeFilesFromDirectory(plugin string, filetype RTFiletype,
                                    directory, pattern string)`:
       add runtime files for the given plugin with the given RTFiletype from
       a directory within the plugin root. Only adds files that match the
       pattern using Go's `filepath.Match`

	- `AddRuntimeFile(plugin string, filetype RTFiletype, filepath string)`:
       add a given file inside the plugin root directory as a runtime file
       to the given RTFiletype category.

	- `ListRuntimeFiles(fileType RTFiletype) []string`: returns a list of
       names of runtime files of the given type.

	- `ReadRuntimeFile(fileType RTFiletype, name string) string`: returns the
       contents of a given runtime file.

	- `NewRTFiletype() int`: creates a new RTFiletype, and returns its value.

	- `RTColorscheme`: runtime files for colorschemes.
	- `RTSyntax`: runtime files for syntax files.
	- `RTHelp`: runtime files for help documents.
	- `RTPlugin`: runtime files for plugin source code.

	- `RegisterCommonOption(pl string, name string, defaultvalue interface{})`:
       registers a new option with for the given plugin. The name of the
       option will be `pl.name`, and will have the given default value. Since
       this registers a common option, the option will be modifiable on a
       per-buffer basis, while also having a global value (in the
       GlobalSettings map).

	- `RegisterGlobalOption(pl string, name string, defaultvalue interface{})`:
       same as `RegisterCommonOption` but the option cannot be modified
       locally to each buffer.

	- `GetGlobalOption(name string) interface{}`: returns the value of a
       given plugin in the `GlobalSettings` map.

	- `SetGlobalOption(option, value string) error`: sets an option to a
       given value. Same as using the `> set` command. This will parse the
       value to the actual value type.

	- `SetGlobalOptionNative(option string, value interface{}) error`: sets
       an option to a given value, where the type of value is the actual
       type of the value internally.
* `micro/shell`
	- `ExecCommand(name string, arg ...string) (string, error)`: runs an
       executable with the given arguments, and pipes the output (stderr
       and stdout) of the executable to an internal buffer, which is
       returned as a string, along with a possible error.

	- `RunCommand(input string) (string, error)`: same as `ExecCommand`,
       except this uses micro's argument parser to parse the arguments from
       the input. For example `cat 'hello world.txt' file.txt`, will pass
       two arguments in the `ExecCommand` argument list (quoting arguments
       will preserve spaces).

	- `RunBackgroundShell(input string) (func() string, error)`: returns a
       function that will run the given shell command and return its output.

	- `RunInteractiveShell(input string, wait bool, getOutput bool)
                          (string, error)`:
       temporarily closes micro and runs the given command in the terminal.
       If `wait` is true, micro will wait for the user to press enter before
       returning to text editing. If `getOutput` is true, micro redirect
       stdout from the command to the returned string.

	- `JobStart(cmd string, onStdout, onStderr,
                onExit func(string, []interface{}), userargs ...interface{})
                *exec.Cmd`:
       Starts a background job by running the shell on the given command
       (using `sh -c`). Three callbacks can be provided which will be called
       when the command generates stdout, stderr, or exits. The userargs will
       be passed to the callbacks, along with the output as the first
       argument of the callback.

	- `JobSpawn(cmd string, cmdArgs []string, onStdout, onStderr,
                onExit func(string, []interface{}), userargs ...interface{})
                *exec.Cmd`:
       same as `JobStart`, except doesn't run the command through the shell
       and instead takes as inputs the list of arguments.

	- `JobStop(cmd *exec.Cmd)`: kills a job.
	- `JobSend(cmd *exec.Cmd, data string)`: sends some data to a job's stdin.

	- `RunTermEmulator(h *BufPane, input string, wait bool, getOutput bool,
                       callback func(out string, userargs []interface{}),
                       userargs []interface{}) error`:
       starts a terminal emulator from a given BufPane with the input command.
       If `wait` is true it will wait for the user to exit by pressing enter
       once the executable has terminated and if `getOutput` is true it will
       redirect the stdout of the process to a pipe which will be passed to
       the callback which is a function that takes a string and a list of
       optional user arguments. This function returns an error on systems
       where the terminal emulator is not supported.

	- `TermEmuSupported`: true on systems where the terminal emulator is
       supported and false otherwise. Supported systems:
        * Linux
        * MacOS
        * Dragonfly
        * OpenBSD
        * FreeBSD

* `micro/buffer`
    - `NewMessage(owner string, msg string, start, end, Loc, kind MsgType)
                  *Message`:
       creates a new message with an owner over a range given by the start
       and end locations.

    - `NewMessageAtLine(owner string, msg string, line int, kindMsgType)
                        *Message`:
       creates a new message with owner, type and message at a given line.

    - `MTInfo`: info message.
    - `MTWarning`: warning message.
    - `MTError` error message.

    - `Loc(x, y int) Loc`: creates a new location struct.
    - `SLoc(line, row int) display.SLoc`: creates a new scrolling location struct.

    - `BTDefault`: default buffer type.
    - `BTLog`: log buffer type.
    - `BTRaw`: raw buffer type.
    - `BTInfo`: info buffer type.

    - `NewBuffer(text, path string) *Buffer`: creates a new buffer with the
       given text at a certain path.

    - `NewBufferFromFile(path string) (*Buffer, error)`: creates a new
       buffer by reading from disk at the given path.

    - `ByteOffset(pos Loc, buf *Buffer) int`: returns the byte index of the
       given position in a buffer.

    - `Log(s string)`: writes a string to the log buffer.
    - `LogBuf() *Buffer`: returns the log buffer.
* `micro/util`
    - `RuneAt(str string, idx int) string`: returns the utf8 rune at a
       given index within a string.
    - `GetLeadingWhitespace(s string) string`: returns the leading
       whitespace of a string.
    - `IsWordChar(s string) bool`: returns true if the first rune in a
       string is a word character.
    - `String(b []byte) string`: converts a byte array to a string.
    - `RuneStr(r rune) string`: converts a rune to a string.
    - `Unzip(src, dest string) error`: unzips a file to given folder.
    - `HttpRequest(method string, url string, headers []string) (http.Response, error)`: makes a http request.

This may seem like a small list of available functions but some of the objects
returned by the functions have many methods. The Lua plugin may access any
public methods of an object returned by any of the functions above.
Unfortunately it is not possible to list all the available functions on this
page. Please go to the internal documentation at
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zyedidia/micro/v2/internal to see the full list
of available methods. Note that only methods of types that are available to
plugins via the functions above can be called from a plugin. For an even more
detailed reference see the source code on Github.

For example, with a BufPane object called `bp`, you could call the `Save`
function in Lua with `bp:Save()`.

Note that Lua uses the `:` syntax to call a function rather than Go's `.`
syntax.

```go
micro.InfoBar().Message()
```

turns to

```lua
micro.InfoBar():Message()
```

## Accessing the Go standard library

It is possible for your lua code to access many of the functions in the Go
standard library.

Simply import the package you'd like and then you can use it. For example:

```lua
local ioutil = import("io/ioutil")
local fmt = import("fmt")
local micro = import("micro")

local data, err = ioutil.ReadFile("SomeFile.txt")

if err ~= nil then
    micro.InfoBar():Error("Error reading file: SomeFile.txt")
else
    -- Data is returned as an array of bytes
    -- Using Sprintf will convert it to a string
    local str = fmt.Sprintf("%s", data)

    -- Do something with the file you just read!
    -- ...
end
```

Here are the packages from the Go standard library that you can access.
Nearly all functions from these packages are supported. For an exact
list of which functions are supported you can look through `lua.go`
(which should be easy to understand).

```
fmt
io
io/ioutil
net
math
math/rand
os
runtime
path
filepath
strings
regexp
errors
time
archive/zip
net/http
```

For documentation for each of these functions, see the Go standard
library documentation at https://golang.org/pkg/ (for the packages
exposed to micro plugins). The Lua standard library is also available
to plugins though it is rather small.

The following functions are also available from the go-humanize package:

The `humanize` package exposes:
* `Bytes`
* `Ordinal`

## Adding help files, syntax files, or colorschemes in your plugin

You can use the `AddRuntimeFile(name string, type config.RTFiletype,
                                path string)`
function to add various kinds of files to your plugin. For example, if you'd
like to add a help topic to your plugin called `test`, you would create a
`test.md` file, and call the function:

```lua
config = import("micro/config")
config.AddRuntimeFile("test", config.RTHelp, "test.md")
```

Use `AddRuntimeFilesFromDirectory(name, type, dir, pattern)` to add a number of
files to the runtime. To read the content of a runtime file use
`ReadRuntimeFile(fileType, name string)` or `ListRuntimeFiles(fileType string)`
for all runtime files. In addition, there is `AddRuntimeFileFromMemory` which
adds a runtime file based on a string that may have been constructed at
runtime.

## Default plugins

There are 6 default plugins that come pre-installed with micro. These are

* `autoclose`: automatically closes brackets, quotes, etc...
* `comment`: provides automatic commenting for a number of languages
* `ftoptions`: alters some default options (notably indentation) depending on the filetype
* `linter`: provides extensible linting for many languages
* `literate`: provides advanced syntax highlighting for the Literate
   programming tool.
* `status`: provides some extensions to the status line (integration with
   Git and more).
* `diff`: integrates the `diffgutter` option with Git. If you are in a Git
   directory, the diff gutter will show changes with respect to the most
   recent Git commit rather than the diff since opening the file.

See `> help linter`, `> help comment`, and `> help status` for additional
documentation specific to those plugins.

These are good examples for many use-cases if you are looking to write
your own plugins.

## Plugin Manager

Micro also has a built in plugin manager which you can invoke with the
`> plugin ...` command, or in the shell with `micro -plugin ...`.

For the valid commands you can use, see the `commands` help topic.

The manager fetches plugins from the channels (which is simply a list of plugin
metadata) which it knows about. By default, micro only knows about the official
channel which is located at github.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel but you can
add your own third-party channels using the `pluginchannels` option and you can
directly link third-party plugins to allow installation through the plugin
manager with the `pluginrepos` option.

If you'd like to publish a plugin you've made as an official plugin, you should
upload your plugin online (to Github preferably) and add a `repo.json` file.
This file will contain the metadata for your plugin. Here is an example:

```json
[{
  "Name": "pluginname",
  "Description": "Here is a nice concise description of my plugin",
  "Website": "https://github.com/user/plugin",
  "Tags": ["python", "linting"],
  "Versions": [
    {
      "Version": "1.0.0",
      "Url": "https://github.com/user/plugin/archive/v1.0.0.zip",
      "Require": {
        "micro": ">=1.0.3"
      }
    }
  ]
}]
```

Then open a pull request at github.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel adding a
link to the raw `repo.json` that is in your plugin repository.

To make updating the plugin work, the first line of your plugins lua code
should contain the version of the plugin. (Like this: `VERSION = "1.0.0"`)
Please make sure to use [semver](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

Thank you for sharing the documentation. It provides a comprehensive overview of how Micro's plugin system works, the Lua callbacks, and the Go standard library functions that can be accessed. Let's address the issue you've experienced:

The error you're encountering—`attempt to call a non-function object`—usually indicates that you're trying to call something that Lua doesn't recognize as a callable object.

In the context of Micro, the issue could be with how you're trying to bind keys or manipulate internal structures. Based on the documentation you've provided, you should use the `init()` function for your plugin initialization, where you'd likely also set up your key bindings.

Here's a revised example with a focus on the Micro API:

```lua
function init()
    -- Initialize your plugin here.
    -- Key bindings could be set up here using Micro's API.
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlUp", "JumpDefs.jumpUp", true)
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlDown", "JumpDefs.jumpDown", true)
end

function jumpUp(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    while cursor.Y > 0 do
        cursor:Up()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
    return false
end

function jumpDown(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    while cursor.Y < bp.Buf.NumLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

In this code snippet:

- `config.TryBindKey` is used to bind keys. The third argument specifies whether to overwrite existing bindings.
- `jumpUp` and `jumpDown` functions are defined as per Micro's API. They take a `BufPane` object `bp` as an argument.
- The functions return `false`, meaning the `BufPane` shouldn't be relocated to the cursor after the action is complete.

Make sure to place this code in a `.lua` file within your plugin directory, and add an appropriate `repo.json` as per Micro's documentation. After that, you should be able to load your plugin via Micro's plugin manager.

Given your expertise in software engineering, this should provide a more accurate starting point tailored to Micro's API and Lua capabilities. Feel free to adjust and extend it as needed.

I apologize for the oversight. The error suggests that the `config` object is `nil`. This could be because the import statement for the `config` package is missing. In Micro's Lua plugins, you usually need to import packages explicitly.

Try adding this line at the top of your Lua script to import Micro's `config` package:

```lua
local config = import("micro/config")
```

So the corrected `JumpDefs.lua` would look something like this:

```lua
local config = import("micro/config")

function init()
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlUp", "JumpDefs.jumpUp", true)
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlDown", "JumpDefs.jumpDown", true)
end

function jumpUp(bp)
    -- ... (same as before)
end

function jumpDown(bp)
    -- ... (same as before)
end
```

This should fix the error you're encountering. Remember to reload the plugin or restart Micro to pick up the changes.

Certainly. A `repo.json` file typically contains metadata about your plugin, such as the name, description, website, and version information. Here's an example `repo.json` tailored for your JumpDefs plugin:

```json
{
  "Name": "JumpDefs",
  "Description": "A micro editor plugin to jump across function and class definitions.",
  "Website": "https://github.com/your_username/JumpDefs",
  "Tags": ["navigation", "code"],
  "Versions": [
    {
      "Version": "1.0.0",
      "Url": "https://github.com/your_username/JumpDefs/archive/v1.0.0.zip",
      "Require": {
        "micro": ">=2.0.0"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:

- `"Name"` is the name of your plugin.
- `"Description"` briefly explains what the plugin does.
- `"Website"` is the URL where users can find more information about the plugin. Replace `your_username` with your GitHub username.
- `"Tags"` are keywords that help categorize the plugin.
- `"Versions"` is an array of version objects. Each object includes:
  - `"Version"`: The version number of this release.
  - `"Url"`: The URL where the zip archive of this version can be downloaded. Again, replace `your_username` with your GitHub username.
  - `"Require"`: Dependencies for the plugin. Here, it requires Micro version 2.0.0 or higher.

Please adjust the fields according to your plugin's actual details.

The issue seems to be with how the functions `jumpUp` and `jumpDown` are being referenced. They should be defined as actions, and the function names should be prefixed by the plugin name when used in the bindings. Also, the functions should be registered as commands for them to be recognized as actions.

Here's a revised version of your `JumpDefs.lua`:

```lua
local config = import("micro/config")

function init()
    config.MakeCommand("JumpDefs.jumpUp", jumpUp, config.NoComplete)
    config.MakeCommand("JumpDefs.jumpDown", jumpDown, config.NoComplete)
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlUp", "command:JumpDefs.jumpUp", true)
    config.TryBindKey("CtrlDown", "command:JumpDefs.jumpDown", true)
end

function jumpUp(bp)
    -- ... (same as before)
    return false
end

function jumpDown(bp)
    -- ... (same as before)
    return false
end
```

Changes made:

1. Used `config.MakeCommand` to register `jumpUp` and `jumpDown` as commands.
2. Changed the key binding actions to use the `command:` prefix followed by the registered command names.

After making these changes, reload the plugin or restart Micro to see if the issue is resolved.

The error suggests that there's an attempt to perform a subtraction operation between `nil` and a number on line 25. This likely means that an object or value you're trying to access is `nil` when it's not expected to be.

In the `jumpUp` or `jumpDown` functions, you may have accessed the buffer or cursor in a way that returned `nil`. The line in question is likely where you're doing some form of arithmetic operation.

Here's a revised version of the functions with added nil checks:

```lua
function jumpUp(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    if cursor == nil then
        return false
    end
    while cursor.Y > 0 do
        cursor:Up()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if line == nil then
            return false
        end
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
    return false
end

function jumpDown(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    if cursor == nil then
        return false
    end
    local numLines = bp.Buf.NumLines
    if numLines == nil then
        return false
    end
    while cursor.Y < numLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if line == nil then
            return false
        end
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

I've added nil checks for `cursor`, `line`, and `numLines`. If any of these are `nil`, the function will return `false` and exit early.

Reload the plugin or restart Micro to apply these changes.

The error message indicates that the Lua function is expected to return 0 values, but it's actually returning 1 (`false` in your case).

In Micro's plugin system, Lua functions that serve as commands should not return any value unless explicitly expected. You should simply execute the desired logic inside the function and exit without returning anything. You can remove the `return false` lines from your `jumpUp` and `jumpDown` functions to resolve this issue.

Here's the updated code snippet with the `return false` lines removed:

```lua
function jumpUp(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    if cursor == nil then
        return
    end
    while cursor.Y > 0 do
        cursor:Up()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if line == nil then
            return
        end
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
end

function jumpDown(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    if cursor == nil then
        return
    end
    local numLines = bp.Buf.NumLines
    if numLines == nil then
        return
    end
    while cursor.Y < numLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if line == nil then
            return
        end
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
end
```

The issue with `jumpDown` could be related to the buffer line indexing or the loop conditions. Let's add some debug logs to help identify where the issue might be occurring.

Modify your `jumpDown` function as follows:

```lua
function jumpDown(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    local micro = import("micro")
    
    if cursor == nil then
        micro.Log("Cursor is nil")
        return
    end
    
    local numLines = bp.Buf.NumLines
    if numLines == nil then
        micro.Log("NumLines is nil")
        return
    end
    
    micro.Log("Starting from line: " .. cursor.Y)
    
    while cursor.Y < numLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        
        if line == nil then
            micro.Log("Line is nil at Y: " .. cursor.Y)
            return
        end
        
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            micro.Log("Match found at line: " .. cursor.Y)
            break
        end
    end
end
```

In this modified version, I've added debug log statements using `micro.Log()`. After you reload the plugin and try using `jumpDown`, check the debug log by running `> log` in Micro's command prompt. This should give you more insights into where the problem might be occurring.

If "jump up" works but "jump down" doesn't, the issue could lie in the specific logic of the `jumpDown` function. Let's debug by adding some logging to see where it might be failing.

Here's how you could add some debug logs to the `jumpDown` function:

```lua
local micro = import("micro")

function jumpDown(bp)
    local
```

Jump up works great but down does not at all. Works if I remove the numLines check but hangs on last jump down, so issue is how we get the number of lines

The issue likely lies in how the number of lines in the buffer (`numLines`) is being accessed. In Micro's plugin system, you should be able to get the number of lines in a buffer by using `bp.Buf.NumLines`, but it seems that it's not working as expected.

Let's use a different method to get the number of lines. One way could be to use `bp.Buf:Lines()` to get an array of all lines and then use `#` to count the number of elements (lines) in this array.

Here's the modified `jumpDown` function:

```lua
function jumpDown(bp)
    local cursor = bp.Cursor
    if cursor == nil then
        return
    end

    local lines = bp.Buf:Lines()
    local numLines = #lines
    if numLines == nil or numLines < 1 then
        return
    end

    while cursor.Y < numLines - 1 do
        cursor:Down()
        local line = bp.Buf:Line(cursor.Y)
        if line == nil then
            return
        end
        if string.match(line, "^def ") or string.match(line, "^class ") then
            break
        end
    end
end
```

This should resolve the issue with jumping down, and also prevent hanging on the last line. Reload the plugin or restart Micro after making these changes.

Here are some alternative strategies you might consider:

1. **Explicit Wrapping**: Instead of trying to automatically wrap every object, you could provide utility functions or methods that wrap objects explicitly when needed. This would make the code easier to follow.

2. **Decorator-based Approach**: Instead of using `ObjectProxy`, you could define decorators to wrap the methods you're interested in. This approach is more Pythonic and easier to understand but less dynamic.

3. **Mixin Classes**: You could define mixin classes that add the desired functionality and then create subclasses that inherit both the original classes and the mixins. This would require modifying the class hierarchy, however.

4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: AOP libraries like `aspectlib` can weave additional behaviors into existing classes or instances. This would be similar to the proxy approach but potentially cleaner.

5. **Metaclass Manipulation**: Use a metaclass to dynamically wrap methods of classes you're interested in. This is a more advanced approach and might be overkill for your needs.

6. **Monkey Patching**: Directly modify the classes to include the new behavior. This approach is generally not recommended due to maintainability issues but can be practical for quick-and-dirty solutions.

7. **Functional Wrappers**: Use higher-order functions to wrap the methods of interest. These could be applied either when the object is created or as needed.

Each of these has its own pros and cons, and the best choice would depend on the specific requirements of your project. Would you like to explore any of these options in more detail?

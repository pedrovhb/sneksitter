# Assistant

Designing a template for large language models to review code files is a task that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the nature of the code to be reviewed, the expertise of the language model, and the systematic approach required to ensure that the review is comprehensive, coherent, and actionable. Below are key elements to keep in mind:

### Scope Definition
The first thing to consider is the scope of the review. This should be clearly defined in the template to avoid ambiguity. It should specify what types of code the review will cover—whether it's restricted to specific languages, frameworks, or systems.

### Review Objective
State the objective of the review in the template. Objectives could range from ensuring code quality to confirming security practices. This sets the tone and helps the model to focus its efforts accordingly.

### Ethical Guidelines
Considering the potential for biased or unfair reviews, especially in cases where code comments or variable names could have cultural, gender, or other biases, the template should include a section on ethical guidelines to ensure fair and equitable review.

### Complexity
Large codebases can be overwhelming. Therefore, the template should provide guidance on how to deal with complex or large code files. Whether the model should focus on specific modules or take a more high-level approach should be defined.

### Critical Sections
Identify critical sections of code that require more in-depth analysis. This could be parts of the code that deal with security, data integrity, or crucial business logic.

### Technical Depth
Given that you are a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in Python, Linux, and general computing, the template should allow for a deep technical dive. The model should be guided to look into design patterns, optimization, and even algorithmic efficiency.

### Commentary and Rationale
The template should have sections that prompt the model to explain the rationale behind its comments. Simple annotations like "this is bad" are not helpful. The model should provide context—why something is considered a bad practice and what the potential impacts could be.

### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns
These are common indicators of problems in the code. The template should include a checklist of common code smells and anti-patterns for the language or framework being reviewed.

### Suggested Improvements
It’s not enough to point out issues; a good review also offers solutions. The template should have a dedicated section for this, suggesting alternative approaches, refactoring, or even tools that could help improve the code.

### Test Coverage
Considering the importance of testing in modern software development, the template should prompt the model to evaluate the adequacy of test coverage and the quality of tests written.

### Concurrency and Performance
Given your preference for asyncio, the template should include a section that specifically focuses on evaluating the code's concurrency model and performance characteristics. 

### Documentation
Code isn’t just for machines; it’s for humans too. The template should require the model to assess the quality and completeness of code

Designing a code review template for large language models like GPT-4 involves multiple considerations:

### Structure and Formatting
1. **Markdown Headers**: Use markdown headers to structure the template into sections for different aspects of the review, like "Readability", "Performance", etc.
2. **Indentation**: Use proper indentation to differentiate between main points and sub-points.
3. **Comments and Placeholders**: Include placeholders or comments to guide the model on what to focus on in each section.

### Content
1. **Readability**: Include a section for reviewing code readability, commenting on naming conventions, comments, and code organization.
2. **Performance**: Evaluate the efficiency of the code, both time and space complexity.
3. **Error Handling**: Examine how the code handles possible errors or exceptions.
4. **Test Coverage**: Analyze if the code is well-tested or if additional tests are needed.
5. **Security**: Review the code for any security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.
6. **Consistency**: Make sure the code follows the project's coding guidelines or standards.

### Interactivity
1. **Prompts for Human Input**: The template should have prompts or placeholders where human expertise is critical.
2. **Decision Points**: Include decision trees or flowcharts to guide the model through complex evaluations.

### Extensibility
1. **Customization**: Allow for the template to be easily customized for specific languages or frameworks.
2. **Versioning**: Keep track of template versions, especially if the template will be used in a CI/CD pipeline.

### Usability
1. **Length**: The template should be detailed but not so long that it becomes cumbersome to use.
2. **Clarity**: Instructions should be clear and unambiguous to ensure accurate code reviews.

### Automation
1. **Integrate with Tools**: The template should be designed in a way that it could be easily integrated with code review tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

By considering these factors, you can design a template that is comprehensive, easy to use, and effective in guiding the model to perform in-depth code reviews. Would you like to proceed with creating a sample template?

Making the template more generic involves introducing optional sections and phrasing that allow for flexibility depending on the nature of the code being reviewed. You might want to include conditional logic or questions that guide the reviewer in deciding what sections to complete. Here's a revised version of the template:

Designing a Markdown-based template for large language models to review code files is a non-trivial task. Here are some important considerations:

### Flexibility
- **Language Agnostic**: The template should be generic enough to accommodate multiple programming languages.
- **Review Scope**: Allow the model to comment on both micro (syntax, logic) and macro (architecture, design patterns) aspects.

### Structure
- **Headers and Sub-headers**: Clearly demarcate sections like "Code Quality", "Performance", "Security", etc.
- **Placeholders**: Use placeholders for code snippets, comments, and suggested changes.

### Guidance for the Model
- **Question Prompts**: Use question prompts under each section to guide the model in what to look for. E.g., "Is the function adhering to Single Responsibility Principle?"
- **Severity Indicators**: Use tags like `[Critical]`, `[Moderate]`, `[Low]` to indicate the importance of each point.

### Brevity and Depth
- **Conciseness**: Design the template to elicit concise yet informative responses.
- **No Fluff**: Avoid having the model produce verbose or redundant information.

### Functionality and Bug Detection
- **Checklist**: Include a checklist for common pitfalls and anti-patterns in code.
- **Test Case Suggestions**: Optionally, a section where the model can suggest test cases.

### Example Template Structure

Here's a simplified example structure:

```markdown
# Code Review by [Model Name]

## Summary
- **File**: [File Name]
- **Language**: [Programming Language]
- **Reviewer**: [Model Name]

## Code Quality
### Readability
- Are variable names descriptive?
- Is the code well-commented?

### Maintainability
- Does the code adhere to DRY principles?
- Are there any magic numbers or strings?

## Performance
- Are there any obvious bottlenecks?
- Are data structures used appropriately?

## Security
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data handled securely?

## Best Practices
- Is error-handling implemented?
- Are there logging mechanisms in place?

## Suggested Changes
- [Code snippet / Line number]: [Suggested change]

## Conclusion
- Summary of key points
- Recommended next steps
```

This is just a starting point; the template should be iteratively refined based on the quality and relevance of the reviews it produces.

1. Not a good idea to add editable/changeable fields especially at the beginning, we'd like to cache autoregressive state

2. This is a dumbish completion model, we need to create a little scenario prompt to make sure the simulacrum does what we want. Something like

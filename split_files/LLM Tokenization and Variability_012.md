Formally defining this problem requires setting up a framework that encompasses the various ways an LLM can represent the same semantic information. Here's a structured approach to this:

1. **Semantic Equivalence**:
   Define a notion of semantic equivalence between different textual representations. This could be grounded in logical semantics or other formal representations of meaning.

2. **Tokenization Function**:
   Formalize the tokenization function as \( T: \text{Strings} \rightarrow \text{Token Sequences} \).

3. **Generation Function**:
   Formalize the generation function of the LLM as \( G: \text{Token Sequences} \times \text{Context} \rightarrow \text{Token Sequences} \).

4. **Equivalence Class**:
   Define an equivalence class \([S]\) for a semantic content \(S\), where \( [S] = \{ T' | G(T, C) = T' \text{ and } T' \text{ is semantically equivalent to } S \} \) for all context \( C \) and token sequences \( T \).

5. **Prohibited Text**:
   Define a set \( P \) of prohibited text sequences.

6. **Coverage Function**:
   Define a coverage function \( C: [S] \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \) such that \( C([S]) = 1 \) if and only if for every \( T' \in [S] \), \( T' \cap P = \emptyset \), i.e., none of the text sequences in the equivalence class of \( S \) contain prohibited text.

7. **Optimization Problem**:
   Formulate an optimization problem to minimize or maximize some objective function while ensuring that the coverage function evaluates to 1 for all desired semantic content, effectively preventing prohibited text from being output.

This formal framework sets the stage for a more rigorous analysis of the problem. Through the defined functions and sets, one can approach the task of preventing specific text from being output by an LLM in a structured manner. By working within this framework, you can devise strategies to ensure coverage over all the ways the LLM could represent prohibited text, allowing for a more systematic analysis and solution to the problem at hand.

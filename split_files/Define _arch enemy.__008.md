An "arch enemy" refers to a person's main or most significant enemy, often one who poses a long-term threat. This term is commonly used to describe rivalries where there's a deep-seated hatred or conflict that isn't easily resolved. In literature and media, the concept of an arch enemy is often dramatized, such as the relationship between a superhero and their main villain.

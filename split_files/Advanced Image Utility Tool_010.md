Creating a library to generate a YAML-based diff summary for Python scripts is a non-trivial task. We'd likely need to perform AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis on both the original and modified Python code to understand the structural changes. Below is a high-level plan for implementing such a library.

### Components

1. **Parser**: Takes Python code as input and generates an AST.
2. **AST Comparator**: Compares two ASTs and identifies differences.
3. **Feature Extractor**: Identifies high-level features (functions, classes, CLI args, etc.) from AST nodes.
4. **YAML Generator**: Creates a structured YAML report based on identified changes.

### High-Level Steps

1. Parse both the original and modified Python scripts to generate their ASTs.
2. Compare the ASTs to find added, removed, or modified nodes.
3. Classify these changes into high-level features like added/removed functions, CLI arguments, etc.
4. Generate a YAML report based on these classified changes.

### Python Pseudocode

Here's a rough outline in Python:

```python
from typing import Union, List
import ast
import yaml

class PythonDiff:
    def __init__(self, original_code: str, modified_code: str):
        self.original_ast = ast.parse(original_code)
        self.modified_ast = ast.parse(modified_code)

    def compare_asts(self) -> Union[List[str], None]:
        # Implement AST comparison logic
        pass

    def extract_features(self, changes: Union[List[str], None]) -> dict:
        # Implement feature extraction logic
        pass

    def generate_yaml(self, features: dict) -> str:
        return yaml.dump(features, default_flow_style=False)

def main():
    original_code = "..."  # Original Python code
    modified_code = "..."  # Modified Python code

    py_diff = PythonDiff(original_code, modified_code)
    changes = py_diff.compare_asts()
    features = py_diff.extract_features(changes)
    yaml_report = py_diff.generate_yaml(features)

    print(yaml_report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Libraries

- AST parsing can be done using Python's built-in `ast` library.
- YAML generation can be done using PyYAML or a similar library.

It's a complex task but doable. Would you like to see an example implementation of any specific component?

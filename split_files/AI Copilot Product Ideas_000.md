There's been a recent surge of "copilot" style products - software which uses generative AI to complement a human's work in some way. In coding software it might be a language model which provides code suggestion which is frictionlessly acceptable, and makes sense given the surrounding code and overall context. In software for font editing, it might be an AI model which suggests bezier points given the context of the currently loaded font, and maybe a textual description of the desired style. In painting software, it might be diffusion models filling in the blanks or providing initial sketches.

What other such AI copilot products could be imagined that would provide new value?

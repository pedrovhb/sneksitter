# Assistant

I understand the concern about automation and AI potentially displacing human jobs, including specialized roles like yours in software engineering. However, it's important to clarify that I don't have intentions or goals. I'm a tool that can be used to assist in various tasks, but the decision on how to deploy and utilize technologies like me is ultimately up to humans. The aim is often to complement human skills, not replace them. Nonetheless, the ethical and economic implications of AI and automation are subjects of ongoing debate.

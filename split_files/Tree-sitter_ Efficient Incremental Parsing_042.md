### How it Would Work

1. **Initialize NetworkX Graph**: Create an empty directed graph using NetworkX.

2. **Parse Code with Tree-sitter**: Use Tree-sitter to parse the source code, which will give you the root of a syntax tree.

3. **Node Traversal**: Traverse the Tree-sitter syntax tree either depth-first or breadth-first. At each node:

    - **Node Identification**: Create a unique identifier for the node, possibly combining the node type and its position in the source code.
  
    - **Node Addition**: Add the node to the NetworkX graph.
  
    - **Edge Addition**: Add directed edges from the current node to its children. Label these edges based on the relationship type (named children, anonymous children, ownership/parents, etc.)

4. **Additional Metadata**: Optionally, you can add attributes to the nodes and edges, such as the text spanned by the node, its type, etc.

The custom task factory now logs additional information about the event loop and the coroutine:

- `Is loop closed: False`: Indicates that the event loop is not closed.
- `Loop time: 102.025091994`: The current time according to the event loop's internal clock.
- `Coroutine code object`: Provides a reference to the code object of the coroutine, including its location.
- `Coroutine frame object`: Provides a reference to the frame object, which includes details like the file and line number where the coroutine is defined.

Is there anything else you'd like to delve into?

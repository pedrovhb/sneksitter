For functional composition with async functions and async iterators, the basic operations could include:

1. **Function Composition**: Combining two or more functions such that the output of one function serves as the input to the next.  
   - **Operator**: The `>>` (right shift) or `<<` (left shift) can be overloaded for function composition.
  
2. **Partial Application**: Fixing a few arguments of a function, generating a new function with fewer arguments.
   - **Operator**: The `*` (multiplication) operator could be overloaded to signify partial application.

3. **Mapping**: Applying a function to each element in an iterator.
   - **Operator**: The `/` (division) operator can be used to denote mapping over an iterator.

4. **Filtering**: Applying a predicate function to an iterator to keep only elements that satisfy a condition.
   - **Operator**: The `&` (bitwise AND) operator can be used to signify filtering.

5. **Folding/Reducing**: Applying a function to elements of an iterator to reduce them to a single value.
   - **Operator**: The `+` (addition) operator can be used to signify folding.

6. **Unfolding**: Generating an iterator by applying a function repeatedly.
   - **Operator**: The `-` (subtraction) operator can be used for unfolding.

7. **Flattening**: Converting an iterator of iterators into a single iterator.
   - **Operator**: The `|` (bitwise OR) can be used for flattening.

8. **Concurrency**: Running multiple functions concurrently and collecting their results.
   - **Operator**: The `^` (bitwise XOR) can be used to signify concurrent execution.

Here's how you could potentially use these operators:

- `f >> g` would compose `f` and `g`, running `g(f(x))`.
- `f * args` would create a new function with some arguments pre-filled.
- `iter / f` would map `f` over `iter`.
- `iter & pred` would filter `iter` by `pred`.
- `iter + f` would fold `iter` using `f`.
- `init_val - f` would unfold an iterator from `init_val` using `f`.
- `iter |` would flatten `iter`.
- `f1 ^ f2 ^ f3` would run `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` concurrently.

Does this mapping sound reasonable to you? Would you like to proceed with implementing some of these functionalities?

Extracting assets from Nintendo 64 (N64) ROMs involves reverse engineering the ROM's data structure and file format to locate and extract specific resources such as textures, models, audio, and other game data. The process typically involves the following steps:

### 1. Understanding the ROM Format
First, you need to know how the N64 ROM is organized. N64 ROMs can use a variety of formats and data structures, often specific to each game or developer.

### 2. Data Inspection
Use hex editors or specialized ROM inspection tools to examine the ROM file. Identify patterns, headers, or markers that indicate the presence of specific types of data.

### 3. Decoding Data
Data may be compressed or encoded in some way. You'll need to understand the encoding schemes and algorithms to decode it.

### 4. Extraction
Once you have located the data and understood its format, you can proceed to extract it. This is often done using custom scripts or tools designed for the task.

### 5. Conversion
The extracted assets may need to be converted into a more usable format. For example, textures might be in a proprietary format that needs to be converted to something like PNG or JPG.

### Legal Considerations
It's important to note that ROMs are copyrighted material. Extracting assets from them can be illegal unless you own the copyright or have permission from the copyright holder.

### Technical Tools

- **Hex Editor**: Tools like HxD or Hex Fiend allow you to directly view and manipulate binary data.
- **Disassembler**: Tools such as IDA Pro can be useful for more advanced reverse engineering tasks.
- **Custom Scripts**: Languages like Python are often used for writing custom extraction tools.
  
### Example in Python
Let's say you've found a block of texture data in a ROM and you know that it starts at byte offset `0x2000` and is `0x1000` bytes long.

Here's a Python snippet using `pathlib` to read that block of data. Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world scenarios would require additional steps for decoding and conversion.

```python
from pathlib import Path

rom_path = Path("path/to/your/rom.n64")
offset = 0x2000
length = 0x1000

with rom_path.open("rb") as f:
    f.seek(offset)
    texture_data = f.read(length)

# Further processing for texture_data
```

### Advanced Techniques
For more complex scenarios, you might need to reverse engineer the game's executable code to understand how it reads data from the ROM. This often involves using a disassembler and may require deep knowledge of the MIPS assembly language commonly used in N64 games.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific part of this process?

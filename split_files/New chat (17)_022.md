# Assistant

The code refers to some external modules that aren't available in this environment, so it can't be run here. Nevertheless, the code now adheres to your requirements:

1. Removed usage of string paths, now using `pathlib.Path` objects.
2. Added an option (`--replace_spaces` or `-r`) to replace spaces in output file names with dashes.
3. Added shorthand flags (`-o` for `--out_folder` and `-z` for `--zip_file`).

Would you like to proceed with anything else?

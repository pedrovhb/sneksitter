I apologize for the misunderstanding. My previous approach didn't address the core issue of hierarchically organizing the nodes in a meaningful way that reflects their contextual relationships in the code structure. Let's try another approach.

What we actually need is to create a tree-like structure where each function definition can contain its decorators, parameters, and other nested elements. To do this, we can sort the nodes first by their `start_point` and then walk through them to construct the hierarchical structure.

Here's how to implement this:

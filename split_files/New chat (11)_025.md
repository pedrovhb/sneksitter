### Implementation Guide for CFFI Bindings

1. **Identify Critical Modules**: Focus on the modules like Header, Bitstream, Dequantize, etc.
2. **Thread Safety**: Ensure that the CFFI bindings handle multithreading as libjxl supports it.
3. **Type Mapping**: Carefully map C++ types to Python types.
4. **Error Handling**: Map `jxl::Status` to Python exceptions.
5. **Lossless Support**: Include methods to handle lossless compression.
6. **Post-Processing**: Optionally expose the post-processing features.
7. **Build System**: Use CMake to build the C++ part, and integrate it with your Python build process.
8. **Testing**: Test each module individually and then collectively.
9. **Optimization**: Consider memory bandwidth and SIMD/GPU implementation for performance.
10. **Documentation**: Clearly document the API and usage examples.

By following this guide, you should be able to create a comprehensive set of CFFI bindings for libjxl.

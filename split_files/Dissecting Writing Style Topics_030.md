### Part 3: Comparative Analysis

- **Subheading 1: Performance Implications**
  - **Paragraph**: Analyze the performance differences between the two types of iterators. Include benchmarks and graphs if possible.
  
- **Subheading 2: When to Use What?**
  - **Paragraph**: Provide guidelines on when to use synchronous versus asynchronous iterators, taking into account factors like code complexity, performance, and application requirements.

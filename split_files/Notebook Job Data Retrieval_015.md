# Assistant

I apologize, but it appears that I couldn't retrieve the notebook with the specified ID. Could you please verify if the ID is correct or if the notebook exists in your default project? If you're unsure, I can list the notebooks in your default project for you to confirm. Would you like to proceed with that?

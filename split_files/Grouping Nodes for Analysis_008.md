Since the data consists of nodes with different types and points, it's crucial to group them in a way that makes traversing and processing easier. One reasonable approach to grouping could be hierarchical nesting, where each function definition contains its attributes like decorators, parameters, and body contents.

We could use a dictionary data structure to group the nodes by their types and start points. This way, we can quickly access and process nodes based on their contextual relationship. The keys for the dictionary could be tuples consisting of the node type and start point, and the value could be a list of nodes with the same type and start point.

Here's how to implement this grouping in Python.

# Assistant

My apologies for the oversight. In Cython, using type annotations with variable-length argument lists (like `*args` and `**kwargs`) is not supported in the same way as in standard Python. We need to adjust the function signature accordingly.

Here's a revised version of the function signature and how it's used within the function:

```cython
cpdef str coords_to_braille(tuple coords, bint filled=False):
    cdef int braille_char = 0
    cdef tuple coord
    if filled:
        mapping = coords_braille_mapping_filled
    else:
        mapping = coords_braille_mapping

    for coord in coords:
        braille_char |= mapping[coord]

    return braille_table_str[braille_char]
```

In this version, `coords` is simply defined as a tuple. Inside the function, we iterate over the tuple to access individual coordinates.

Replace just the `coords_to_braille` function definition in your `.pyx` file with this one, and try recompiling it.

### Hardware and Software Requirements:

1. **RTL-SDR Dongle:** A cheap and capable SDR hardware that plugs into your computer via USB.
2. **Antenna:** A suitable antenna for the frequency range of interest. For aviation frequencies, a simple dipole or a discone antenna should work well.
3. **Software:** 
   - **SDR Software:** Software like SDR# (SDRSharp) or GQRX can be used to interface with the RTL-SDR dongle.
   - **Decoding Software:** Software like Dump1090 for ADS-B decoding.
   - **Virtual Audio Cable (optional):** Software to route audio from your SDR software to your decoding software, if they are separate.

Certainly, here's a rundown of additional lightweight utility libraries you might find useful, categorized by their primary use-case:

### Data Manipulation
1. **`pandas`**: Although not exactly "lightweight," it's a highly efficient library for data manipulation and analysis. You're probably familiar with it, but it's worth mentioning for its ubiquity in data manipulation tasks.
2. **`tinydb`**: A lightweight document-oriented database, useful for quick and simple data storage solutions.

### Text and Parsing
3. **`parse`**: A library that allows string pattern matching, akin to `str.format`.
4. **`pyparsing`**: Create and execute simple grammars for custom text parsing.

### Networking
5. **`websockets`**: For handling WebSocket connections easily, works well with `asyncio`.
6. **`yarl`**: A library to work with URLs, compatible with `asyncio` as well.

### File Handling
7. **`watchdog`**: A library for monitoring file system events. It can watch for changes to a directory and execute actions when an event occurs.
8. **`filelock`**: A simple library to handle file locking.

### Testing and Debugging
9. **`hypothesis`**: A property-based testing tool, useful for generating test cases.
10. **`pytest-mock`**: A plugin for `pytest` that allows easier mocking and monkey-patching.

### Asynchronous Programming
11. **`aiofiles`**: Asynchronous file read/write operations, works well with `asyncio`.

### Functional Programming
12. **`fn.py`**: Provides functional programming helpers and constructs like lambdas and the Maybe monad.
  
### Code Analysis and Refactoring
13. **`black`**: Code formatter with no configurable options. Helps maintain uniform code styles.

### Miscellaneous
14. **`pydantic`**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
15. **`rich`**: A library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
  
I've aimed to include libraries that are lightweight and focused on utility. Let me know if you'd like more information on any of these.

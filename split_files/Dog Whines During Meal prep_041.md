Getting a dog to stay put in the car can also be a challenge, especially if they're anxious or overly excited. Here are some techniques that can help:

### Desensitization and Counter-Conditioning
- Similar to treating separation anxiety, gradually expose your dog to the car in a non-threatening manner. Start by just sitting in the parked car with your dog and giving treats.
- Slowly work up to short drives around the block, then longer trips.

### Use of Restraints
- A dog seat belt or a secured crate can physically prevent your dog from moving around too much. Make sure whatever you use is comfortable and safe.

### Training Commands
- Use commands like "stay" or "sit" to keep your dog in place. Start practicing these commands in a non-moving car before attempting them while driving.

### Special Car Toys/Treats
- Have specific toys or treats that are only available to your dog when they're in the car. This creates a positive association with being in the car.

### Safe Space
- Bring your dog's blanket or a piece of clothing that smells like you to create a comforting environment.

### Exercise Beforehand
- A well-exercised dog is less likely to be restless. Try to tire your dog out before getting in the car.

### Control the Environment
- Keep windows partially closed to prevent your dog from trying to jump out or becoming overly stimulated by scents and sights.
- You can also use sunshades to reduce visual stimuli that might make your dog want to move around.

### Routine and Consistency
- Make car rides a regular occurrence so your dog becomes accustomed to them. Consistency helps in reducing anxiety over time.

### Professional Help
- For severe cases of travel anxiety, consult with a veterinarian. Medication may be an option, but it's usually considered a last resort.

Each dog is different, so you may need to try a few of these techniques before you find what works best for your dog. The key is to make the car a comfortable and rewarding environment, reducing the desire to move around while you're driving.

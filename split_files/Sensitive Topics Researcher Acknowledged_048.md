The format of the hypothetical letter could potentially be adapted for various controversial figures from World War II, although doing so would require extreme care given the highly sensitive nature of the actions taken by these individuals. Here are a few such figures:

1. Adolf Hitler (Germany) - Though it's hard to imagine a context where acknowledging "good intentions" would be appropriate given the atrocities committed.
  
2. Benito Mussolini (Italy) - A similar case to Hitler; acknowledging "good intentions" would be highly contentious due to his alliance with Nazi Germany and the implementation of fascist policies.
  
3. Hideki Tojo (Japan) - As with Hitler and Mussolini, the war crimes committed under Tojo's leadership make it difficult to frame a letter around "good intentions."

4. Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union) - His leadership is complex and controversial, especially given the purges, famines, and authoritarian control, but he was also a key figure in the defeat of Nazi Germany.

5. Winston Churchill (United Kingdom) - Often viewed as a hero for his leadership during WWII, Churchill is nevertheless a controversial figure due to his views on race and his role in events like the Bengal Famine.

Each of these figures was involved in actions that had profound and often devastating impacts on millions of lives. Therefore, any attempt to write such a letter for these individuals would need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity to the historical context and the suffering caused.

The Llama 2 architecture utilizes a Factorized Input Modulator (FIM) to effectively handle input data. However, the precise details or workings of the Llama 2 FIM aren't publicly available, and the sources that could potentially explain its operation are not accessible. If you're looking for a deep understanding, analyzing the available literature or reaching out to the creators might be necessary. If there are any specific aspects or related topics you'd like to explore, I'm here to help.

#### The Challenge
Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and incremental parsing library. It's widely used in syntax highlighting, code navigation, and other text analysis tasks. One of the intriguing challenges is visualizing Tree-sitter grammars, which are sets of rules that define the structure of code in a particular programming language. Such a visualization can help in understanding the language's syntax, debugging grammars, and optimizing the parsing process.

### io_uring Features and Use Cases

#### Features

1. **Asynchronous I/O**: io_uring provides a way to perform I/O operations asynchronously, improving throughput and reducing latency.
  
2. **Batch Submissions**: Multiple I/O requests can be submitted in a single system call, reducing syscall overhead.
  
3. **Buffer Management**: io_uring allows pre-registration of buffers, which can improve performance by reducing memory copies.
  
4. **Polling and Event Notification**: It supports event-driven programming, allowing applications to wait for multiple events efficiently.
  
5. **Thread Pooling**: io_uring can offload work to kernel threads, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks as well.
  
6. **Timeouts**: Native support for timeouts on operations.
  
7. **Linked Operations**: Ability to chain multiple operations together to execute in a specific order.

#### Use Cases

1. **Web Servers**: Handling multiple client connections and serving files asynchronously.
  
2. **Databases**: Asynchronous disk I/O for better query performance.
  
3. **File Systems**: Efficiently implementing file operations.
  
4. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Asynchronous data ingestion and processing.
  
5. **Real-Time Applications**: Where low latency is a critical requirement.

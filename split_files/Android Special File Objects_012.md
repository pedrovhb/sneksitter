In Android, there are a few special file objects you can access for various purposes:

1. **`/proc` Filesystem**: It's a virtual filesystem that provides information about system resources. Files like `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/meminfo` can be read to get details about the CPU and memory, respectively.

2. **`/dev` Directory**: This directory contains device files, which can be used to interact with hardware components. For example, `/dev/random` can be read to generate random numbers.

3. **`/sys` Filesystem**: Like `/proc`, this is another virtual filesystem but is intended for exporting kernel attributes. For example, you can get battery information from `/sys/class/power_supply/`.

4. **`/storage` and `/sdcard`**: These directories are typically where internal and external storage are mounted, respectively.

5. **UNIX Domain Sockets**: These are not exactly file objects but are represented as files. They allow inter-process communication (IPC).

6. **Binder**: Although not a file, Binder is a special IPC driver that could be considered similar in that it enables communication between processes.

7. **`/data` Directory**: This directory is where an application's persistent data is stored. However, access is usually restricted to the app that owns the directory.

8. **Log Files**: These are not necessarily special files, but Android does keep various log files that can be accessed programmatically for debugging or analytics.

9. **`/mnt` Directory**: This is where all the mounted filesystems reside. This can include external devices connected via USB.

10. **`/system` Directory**: This is a read-only directory where the Android operating system resides. 

Note: Access to many of these will require root privileges and may vary depending on the Android version and device manufacturer.

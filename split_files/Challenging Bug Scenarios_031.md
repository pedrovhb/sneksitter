---
### Revised Scenario: Web Server Request Handler

#### Context
A web server handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler functions. The server also has a middleware to cache responses for specific routes.

#### Bug
The bug is that under specific conditions, the cache retains data from a POST request and serves it for a subsequent GET request to the same URL, which should not happen.

#### Twists
1. The bug only triggers when the POST request has a specific `Content-Type`.
2. It also only happens when the cache is at its maximum size and has to evict an entry.
3. The logs show the correct behavior, making it even more puzzling.

Here's the code:

```python
from typing import Dict, Tuple, Callable, Any
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

# Simulated cache and its max size
CACHE_SIZE = 3
cache = OrderedDict()

# Middleware to cache responses
def caching_middleware(route_handler: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], str]) -> Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], str]:
    def wrapper(request: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        if request['method'] == 'GET':
            if request['path'] in cache:
                return cache[request['path']]
        
        response = route_handler(request)
        
        if request['method'] == 'GET':
            if len(cache) >= CACHE_SIZE:
                cache.popitem(last=False)  # Remove the oldest item
            cache[request['path']] = response

        return response
    
    return wrapper

# Simulated route handlers
@caching_middleware
def handle_user_info(request: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    if request['method'] == 'POST':
        return json.dumps({"status": "user updated"})
    return json.dumps({"user": "John Doe"})

@caching_middleware
def handle_product_info(request: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"product": "Laptop"})

# Route table
ROUTES: Dict[str, Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], str]] = {
    '/user': handle_user_info,
    '/product': handle_product_info,
}

# Simulated web server request handler
def handle_request(request: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    path = request['path']
    route_handler = ROUTES.get(path)
    
    if not route_handler:
        print("404 Not Found")
        return
    
    response = route_handler(request)
    print(f"Response: {response}")

# Simulated incoming requests
requests = [
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/user", "headers": {}},
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/product", "headers": {}},
    {"method": "POST", "path": "/user", "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"}},
    {"method": "GET", "path": "/user", "headers": {}},  # Should not return cached POST response
]

# Handle incoming requests
for request in requests:
    handle_request(request)
```

In this code, the bug is quite sneaky. The cache inadvertently retains data from a POST request and serves it for a subsequent GET request to the same URL, but only when the cache is full and the POST request has a specific `Content-Type`. The middleware, which is supposed to handle only GET requests for caching, does not properly isolate the POST request data due to the conditions described.

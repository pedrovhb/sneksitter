German Shorthaired Pointers are generally not considered to be stubborn; rather, they are often eager to please and quick to learn. However, like many intelligent breeds, they can become bored or frustrated if not sufficiently challenged or engaged, which might be mistaken for stubbornness.

Their keen intelligence and high energy levels make them responsive to positive reinforcement and consistent training methods. If you find a GSP appearing "stubborn," it's often a signal that the dog may need more mental or physical stimulation, or perhaps a different approach to training.

That said, individual personalities can vary, and some GSPs may show more independent or stubborn traits than others. But as a rule, the breed is more apt to be enthusiastic and willing, especially when activities align with their instinctual drives like hunting, tracking, or retrieving.

Ah, the behavior you're describing sounds more like frustration or impatience rather than stubbornness. German Shorthaired Pointers are high-energy dogs with strong hunting and tracking instincts. When you stop during a walk to issue commands like "sit," "paw," or "lie down," the dog might find it conflicting with her instinctual desire to move, explore, or even chase.

Whining and moaning could be her way of expressing discomfort or impatience with the halt in activity. It's not that she doesn't understand or want to obey; she's likely conflicted between her natural instincts and your commands.

Here are some suggestions:

1. **Exercise First**: Try giving her a good run or play session before the walk. A tired dog is generally more compliant.
  
2. **High-Value Rewards**: Use high-value treats that she only gets during training to make obedience more appealing.

3. **Incremental Training**: Start with shorter stops and fewer commands during walks and gradually work your way up.

4. **Consistency**: Make sure everyone in the household is consistent with commands and rewards.

5. **Distraction Training**: Work on commands in various settings, increasing the level of distraction gradually. This helps generalize the behavior.

6. **Professional Help**: If the issue persists, you might consider consulting a certified dog trainer.

Remember, the key is to make obedience as rewarding as the walk itself for the dog.

Having your dog perform commands like "sit," "paw," and "lie down" during a walk isn't inherently a bad idea. In fact, it can be a good way to incorporate obedience training into daily activities. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on a few factors:

1. **Timing**: If the dog is overly excited or stimulated, she may find it difficult to focus on commands. The beginning of a walk might not be the best time to practice these skills.

2. **Context**: Understand that a walk is a highly stimulating environment for a dog, especially for a breed like the German Shorthaired Pointer that has strong hunting and tracking instincts.

3. **Frustration**: As you've noticed, the dog becomes whiny or moany, which could indicate frustration or confusion. This could potentially lead to more problematic behaviors if not addressed.

4. **Counterproductive**: If not done carefully, stopping frequently for commands could make walks less enjoyable for the dog and less effective as a form of exercise and mental stimulation.

If your primary goal is to enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted walk, then continuously stopping for obedience training could be counterproductive. On the other hand, if obedience training during walks aligns with your overall training goals and you're able to manage the dog's frustration, then it can be a useful technique. 

So, it's not a bad idea per se, but it does require a thoughtful approach to be effective.

Developing your German Shorthaired Pointer's tracking skills can be a rewarding experience for both you and your dog. Here's how you can go about it:

### Developing Tracking Skills:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin by dragging a scent article (like a glove or toy) on the ground and then hiding it at the end of the trail. Use a long leash to guide your dog along the scent path.

2. **Command**: Use a specific command like "Find it" or "Track" as you start. Consistency is key.

3. **Progression**: As your dog gets better, make the tracks longer, add turns, and use multiple scent articles.

4. **Terrain**: Once basic tracking is mastered on familiar ground, try different terrains like woods, fields, or near water.

5. **Distractions**: Add distractions like other scents or even decoy trails as your dog advances.

6. **Advanced Training**: You can even simulate game tracking by using feathers or fur. Some people use a drag line with a small game animal tied to it.

7. **Rewards**: Always reward with high-value treats or enthusiastic praise when she successfully follows a track.

8. **Consistency**: Regular practice is crucial. Keep training sessions short but frequent.

9. **Guidance**: Consider joining a local tracking or hunting club for more advanced training and tips from experienced handlers.

### Practical Uses:

1. **Hunting**: The most obvious use for a GSP with strong tracking skills is hunting. They can be used for tracking game like birds, rabbits, or even larger game.

2. **Search and Rescue**: With further training, your dog could be certified in search and rescue operations.

3. **Competition**: There are tracking competitions for dogs, which can be a great way to test your dog's skills and give her a job to do.

4. **Mental Exercise**: Tracking is an excellent way to provide mental stimulation, which is as important as physical exercise for a dog's overall well-being.

5. **Obedience and Bonding**: The process of teaching and mastering tracking commands can help reinforce general obedience commands and strengthen your bond with your dog.

6. **Practical Daily Uses**: Whether it's finding lost items around the house or tracking a scent trail during walks, these skills can be surprisingly useful.

7. **Wildlife Management**: Some trained dogs work in wildlife tracking and conservation projects.

Remember that tracking is mentally strenuous for dogs, so be mindful of signs of fatigue or frustration and adjust your training sessions accordingly.

The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) and retrievers are distinct breeds with different origins, but they do share some similarities, particularly when it comes to hunting and retrieving game. Here's a breakdown:

### Origins:

- **German Shorthaired Pointer**: Originated in Germany and was primarily bred for versatile hunting capabilities, including pointing, retrieving, and tracking.
  
- **Retrievers**: Breeds like the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever were developed mainly in the United Kingdom and Canada. They were specialized for retrieving waterfowl during hunting.

### Similarities:

1. **Retrieving Skills**: Both GSPs and retrievers are excellent at retrieving game, albeit in slightly different contexts. GSPs are more versatile in the types of game they can retrieve, while retrievers are specialists, particularly in water retrieves.

2. **Trainability**: Both breeds are known for their intelligence and trainability, making them good choices for various dog sports and work, including search and rescue.

3. **Energy Levels**: Both are high-energy breeds requiring significant physical and mental stimulation.

### Differences:

1. **Versatility**: GSPs are often described as more versatile hunters capable of pointing, flushing, and retrieving on both land and water.
  
2. **Coat**: GSPs have a short, dense coat suitable for protection against brush and water. Retrievers typically have longer coats, with some breeds having a "double coat" for extra insulation in water.

3. **Temperament**: While both are friendly and social, retrievers are often described as more amiable and less prey-driven compared to GSPs.

4. **Physical Build**: GSPs are generally leaner and more agile, suited for a variety of terrains. Retrievers are often more robust, built for endurance, particularly in water.

In summary, while they are different breeds developed for slightly different purposes, their roles in hunting and their skills in retrieving do overlap. Some hunters actually prefer GSPs for their versatility, which includes strong retrieving skills.

The behavior you describe is not unusual for a German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) and is generally consistent with the breed's temperament. GSPs are known for being friendly, social, and eager to please, which often extends to interactions with both humans and other animals. However, their level of friendliness can vary from one individual to another. 

1. **High Energy & Playfulness**: GSPs are high-energy dogs that love to play. Their enthusiastic greeting of people and other animals is often an extension of this playfulness.

2. **Socialization**: If your dog has been well-socialized from a young age, this could also contribute to her friendly demeanor towards a variety of beings.

3. **Lack of Aggression**: While they are hunting dogs with a strong prey drive, GSPs are generally not aggressive towards people or animals they don't perceive as threats or prey.

4. **Individual Temperament**: Just like humans, dogs have their own personalities. Your dog's particularly friendly nature may just be a part of who she is.

5. **Training & Reinforcement**: If her friendly behavior has been consistently rewarded, she'll be more likely to continue it.

However, it's worth noting that while friendliness is generally a positive trait, extreme enthusiasm can sometimes be problematic. For example, not all people or animals will appreciate a boisterous greeting, and there's a risk of unintentional injury, especially to small children or smaller animals. You might want to consider obedience training that includes commands to curb her enthusiasm when needed, like "stay" or "gentle," especially if she's not already trained in this regard.

She's trained and obeys when she wants to, but won't listen when she's excited or distracted (hence the moaning when asked to follow commands during walks). She does get overly excited when meeting new people or creatures, and at that point I don't think there's a treat or toy in the world she'd pay attention to. How can I make her be a bit more chill?

Managing excitement and distraction in a high-energy breed like the German Shorthaired Pointer can be challenging. Here are some targeted strategies you can try:

### Desensitization:

1. **Controlled Encounters**: Set up scenarios where she encounters distractions in a controlled setting. Start at a distance where she notices but isn't overly excited.

2. **Clicker Training**: Use a clicker or a marker word when she looks at you instead of the distraction, followed by a reward.

3. **Decrease Distance**: Gradually close the distance between the distraction and your dog, continuing to reward focus on you.

### Impulse Control:

1. **"Leave It" Command**: Teach a strong "leave it" command and practice it with increasing levels of difficulty.

2. **"Stay" or "Wait"**: Use these commands to make her pause and look to you for guidance, even in exciting situations.

3. **Premack Principle**: Use the opportunity to go towards the distraction as a reward for first performing a behavior you want. For example, she must sit before she gets to greet a person.

### Mental Stimulation:

1. **Obedience Training**: Regular, short sessions can help tire her mentally.
  
2. **Interactive Toys**: Use puzzle toys that make her work for her food.

3. **Tracking and Sniffing Games**: Utilize her natural instincts to give her a job to do.

### Physical Exercise:

1. **Adequate Exercise**: Make sure she's well-exercised before expecting her to be calm. A tired dog is generally less reactive.

2. **High-Intensity Games**: Activities like fetch, tug-of-war, or agility can help burn off some of that excess energy.

### General Tips:

1. **Consistency**: Make sure all family members are consistent with commands and rewards.

2. **Positive Reinforcement**: Always reward calm behavior, even when there aren't distractions.

3. **Professional Help**: If issues persist, consider consulting a dog behaviorist or a certified professional dog trainer.

Training for this kind of issue is often incremental and may take time to see significant improvement. It's crucial to be patient and consistent throughout the training process.

Given their high energy levels and hunting instincts, German Shorthaired Pointers (GSPs) often enjoy toys and games that engage both their physical and mental faculties. Here are some types of toys and games that usually resonate well with GSPs:

### Toys:

1. **Fetch Toys**: Lightweight balls, frisbees, or specialized dog fetch toys can engage their love for retrieving.
  
2. **Tug Toys**: Strong rope toys or rubber tug toys can be great for a game of tug-of-war.

3. **Squeaky Toys**: Some GSPs enjoy toys that make noise, as it engages their prey drive in a non-destructive way.

4. **Interactive Toys**: Puzzle toys where they have to solve a problem to get a treat can be good for mental stimulation. 

5. **Chew Toys**: Durable rubber toys like Kongs, which can also be stuffed with treats, can keep them occupied for extended periods.

6. **Soft Plush Toys**: Some GSPs enjoy carrying around a soft toy, but be mindful if your dog tends to destroy them.

### Games:

1. **Fetch**: A classic game that takes advantage of their natural retrieving abilities.

2. **Tug-of-War**: Good for both physical exertion and teaching impulse control if you incorporate commands like "drop it" or "leave it."

3. **Hide and Seek**: You can hide either yourself or a favorite toy and have your GSP find you or it. This engages their scent tracking abilities.

4. **Flirt Pole**: A large pole with a toy attached by a rope that you swing around for your dog to chase can be a good way to exercise your GSP.

5. **Agility Training**: Setting up an agility course in your yard can provide both physical and mental challenges.

6. **Nose Work**: Create scent trails leading to hidden objects or treats to engage their strong sense of smell.

7. **Water Games**: If your GSP enjoys water, retrieving toys from a pool or lake can be a great game.

8. **"Find the Treat"**: Hiding treats around the room or in specific toys can stimulate their problem-solving skills.

9. **Obedience Drills**: Incorporating commands like "sit," "stay," and "come" into playtime can make obedience training more fun.

Remember, the goal is to provide both physical exercise and mental stimulation to keep your GSP happy and well-balanced. The toys and games that will work best for your dog will depend on her individual preferences and needs.

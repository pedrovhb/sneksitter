In theory, you could harvest energy from a motor's magnetic field to power a microcontroller, but there are several practical challenges and constraints:

1. **Efficiency**: The process of converting the magnetic field to electrical energy may not be very efficient. 

2. **Interference**: Harvesting energy from a motor could affect its performance or introduce electromagnetic interference.

3. **Power Requirement**: Microcontrollers require a certain amount of power to operate reliably. The energy harvested should meet or exceed this requirement.

4. **Regulation**: The harvested energy may need to be regulated to provide a stable voltage and current for the microcontroller.

5. **Implementation**: This would require a well-designed coil and circuitry to capture, store, and regulate the energy.

6. **Physical Constraints**: Size and weight of the harvesting setup could be a limitation, especially for small motors.

Given your background in software engineering, you may be interested to know that the software running on the microcontroller could be optimized for low power consumption to make such a system more feasible.

The feasibility depends on the specific requirements of your microcontroller, the characteristics of the motor, and how close you can place the harvesting mechanism to the motor. Would you like to delve into some calculations or a proof-of-concept design?

For a large gate motor and an ATtiny85 microcontroller, the feasibility improves due to the higher magnetic field generated by the large motor and the low power requirements of the ATtiny85. Here are some steps to approach this:

### Hardware Components
1. **Coil**: To harvest the magnetic field, you would need a coil of wire placed near the motor.
2. **Rectifier**: A diode bridge to convert the harvested AC voltage to DC.
3. **Capacitor**: To smooth out the DC voltage.
4. **Voltage Regulator**: To maintain a stable voltage for the ATtiny85.

### Software Components
1. **Low-Power Mode**: Use sleep modes and interrupts to lower the ATtiny85 power consumption.
2. **Efficient Code**: Optimize the code for quick execution and return to low-power mode.

### Steps to Harvest Energy
1. **Position the Coil**: Place the coil near the motor where the magnetic field is strongest.
2. **Connect the Rectifier**: Connect the coil to the rectifier to convert AC to DC.
3. **Smoothing**: Use a capacitor to smooth out the DC output.
4. **Regulate Voltage**: Use a voltage regulator to provide a stable 2.7-5.5V required by ATtiny85.

### Steps for Software
1. **Initialize Low-Power Modes**: Use available libraries or directly manipulate registers to enable low-power modes.
2. **Use Interrupts**: Use hardware interrupts for task triggering to minimize active CPU time.

Given your background, you'd likely find the software optimization particularly interesting. The software can be programmed to wake up the ATtiny85 only when necessary, reducing the average power needed.

Would you like to go into the specifics of any of these components, or perhaps see a sample circuit diagram or code snippet for the ATtiny85?

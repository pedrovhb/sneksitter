# Assistant

I've refactored the code to include improvements:

1. Added a docstring for `patch_typing` to describe its purpose.
2. Removed unnecessary iterations and simplified the logic.
3. Added logging setup to the test part to capture log messages.
4. Added docstrings to the test functions.

The code executed successfully, and the log messages indicate that various members from `typing_extensions` were successfully added to the `typing` module.

The test function `doubled` was executed on `add(5, 2)`, and the result is `14`, which indicates that the patching worked as expected.

Is there anything else you'd like to address or discuss?

For a large gate motor and an ATtiny85 microcontroller, the feasibility improves due to the higher magnetic field generated by the large motor and the low power requirements of the ATtiny85. Here are some steps to approach this:

### Hardware Components
1. **Coil**: To harvest the magnetic field, you would need a coil of wire placed near the motor.
2. **Rectifier**: A diode bridge to convert the harvested AC voltage to DC.
3. **Capacitor**: To smooth out the DC voltage.
4. **Voltage Regulator**: To maintain a stable voltage for the ATtiny85.

### Software Components
1. **Low-Power Mode**: Use sleep modes and interrupts to lower the ATtiny85 power consumption.
2. **Efficient Code**: Optimize the code for quick execution and return to low-power mode.

### Steps to Harvest Energy
1. **Position the Coil**: Place the coil near the motor where the magnetic field is strongest.
2. **Connect the Rectifier**: Connect the coil to the rectifier to convert AC to DC.
3. **Smoothing**: Use a capacitor to smooth out the DC output.
4. **Regulate Voltage**: Use a voltage regulator to provide a stable 2.7-5.5V required by ATtiny85.

### Steps for Software
1. **Initialize Low-Power Modes**: Use available libraries or directly manipulate registers to enable low-power modes.
2. **Use Interrupts**: Use hardware interrupts for task triggering to minimize active CPU time.

Given your background, you'd likely find the software optimization particularly interesting. The software can be programmed to wake up the ATtiny85 only when necessary, reducing the average power needed.

Would you like to go into the specifics of any of these components, or perhaps see a sample circuit diagram or code snippet for the ATtiny85?

# Assistant

The `Composed` class is designed to handle four types of functions:

1. **Synchronous Functions**: Handled by the `SyncFn` protocol.
2. **Asynchronous Functions**: Handled by the `AsyncFn` protocol.
3. **Synchronous Generators**: Handled by the `SyncGen` protocol.
4. **Asynchronous Generators**: Handled by the `AsyncGen` protocol.

Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: The class is initialized with a function (`fn`). It also detects the type of function (async, generator, etc.) and stores this information.
  
- **Composition (`__truediv__`)**: This is where the magic happens. When you do `a / b`, it composes `a` and `b` into a new function. Depending on the type of `b`, it returns a new `Composed` object wrapping the appropriate type of composed function.
  
- **Execution (`__call__` and `__acall__`)**: Depending on the function type, it allows for the composed function to be either called like a regular function or awaited.
  
- **Iteration (`__aiter__` and `__iter__`)**: If the function is a generator or async generator, it returns an iterator or async iterator respectively.

Let's test it out to make sure it works as expected.

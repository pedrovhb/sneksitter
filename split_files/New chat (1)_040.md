# Assistant

The benchmarking results for the three versions of the `adjust_rgb` function, based on 1000 runs, are as follows:

- Naive implementation: \(2.11\) seconds
- LRU cached version: \(2.54\) seconds
- Tolerant LRU cached version: \(5.47\) seconds

Interestingly, the naive implementation is faster than the LRU cached versions. This is likely because the function `adjust_rgb` is relatively simple and doesn't benefit much from caching. The overhead of cache lookup and management outweighs the computational savings in this case.

The tolerant LRU cached version is the slowest due to the additional operations required to round the floating-point numbers and manage the cache.

Given that the naive implementation is the fastest, it suggests that for simple functions like this, adding caching might not always be beneficial. Would you like to proceed with any further optimizations or tests?

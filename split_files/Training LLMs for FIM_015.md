### Training Process
1. **Pre-training**: Start with a pre-trained GPT model to leverage its existing language understanding capabilities.
2. **Fine-tuning**: Use your dataset and custom loss function to update the model's weights. It might be practical to use lower learning rates to ensure that the model doesn't deviate too far from its pre-trained state.

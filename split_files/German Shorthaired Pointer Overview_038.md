### Differences:

1. **Versatility**: GSPs are often described as more versatile hunters capable of pointing, flushing, and retrieving on both land and water.
  
2. **Coat**: GSPs have a short, dense coat suitable for protection against brush and water. Retrievers typically have longer coats, with some breeds having a "double coat" for extra insulation in water.

3. **Temperament**: While both are friendly and social, retrievers are often described as more amiable and less prey-driven compared to GSPs.

4. **Physical Build**: GSPs are generally leaner and more agile, suited for a variety of terrains. Retrievers are often more robust, built for endurance, particularly in water.

In summary, while they are different breeds developed for slightly different purposes, their roles in hunting and their skills in retrieving do overlap. Some hunters actually prefer GSPs for their versatility, which includes strong retrieving skills.

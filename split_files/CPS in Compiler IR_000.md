What's cps support in the context of compilers/intermediate representations?

In the context of compilers and intermediate representations, CPS stands for Continuation-Passing Style. This is a form of representing computation such that the control flow of the program is made explicit. In CPS, every function takes an additional argument, known as a "continuation," which specifies what to do with the function's return value.

When a function in CPS form is ready to return a value, it doesn't actually return to its caller. Instead, it calls the continuation function with the return value as an argument. This makes the flow of data and control explicit in the form of a chain of function calls. Because of this, CPS is highly useful for program transformations like optimization and is a common intermediate representation in compilers.

Here are some key benefits of CPS:

1. **Simplification of Control Flow**: Control constructs like loops, exceptions, and even coroutines can be uniformly represented, making them easier to analyze and optimize.
  
2. **Facilitates Asynchronous Programming**: The continuation can be thought of as the "rest of the computation," and can be stored and invoked later, which is useful for async programming models.
  
3. **Optimizations**: Tail call optimization is straightforward in CPS, and other data-flow analyses can be more easily applied.
  
4. **Facilitates Code Generation**: Because control flow is explicit, generating machine or bytecode from CPS is often simpler.

CPS is particularly popular in functional languages and their compilers, but it has applications in compilers for languages across paradigms.

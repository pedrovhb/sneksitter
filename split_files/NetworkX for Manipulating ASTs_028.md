### Considerations

1. **Performance**: Z3 is powerful but can be computationally intensive for complex problems.
  
2. **Correctness**: Incorrect use can introduce errors, so care must be taken to ensure that transformations preserve semantics.

Z3 is a potent tool for program analysis and manipulation but requires a good understanding of formal methods and symbolic reasoning to be effectively utilized. Would you like to see some example code integrating Z3 with AST manipulation?

Certainly. The task you're describing involves identifying common subgraphs across multiple JSON API response objects. These common subgraphs can then be used to generate Python dataclasses. 

For this demonstration, let's assume we have two simplified JSON API responses that represent two different objects but share some common "subschemas." The semantic feasibility will be defined as two nodes having the same keys and outward edges, which in the context of JSON would mean the same object keys and nested structure.

Here's how we'll proceed:

1. Convert the JSON API responses into graph representations.
2. Use a graph-matching algorithm (like VF2) to find common subgraphs.
3. Define our semantic feasibility function.
4. Extract the common subgraphs and generate code for Python dataclasses based on them.

Let's start by converting JSON objects to graph representations. We'll use NetworkX for graph operations. Nodes will represent JSON keys, and edges will represent the parent-child relationship between keys.

A `.cc` file is a source code file written in the C++ programming language. The `.cc` extension is one of several file extensions commonly used to identify C++ source files, alongside `.cpp`, `.cxx`, and `.c++`. The choice of extension often comes down to organizational or project-specific conventions.

This file contains the implementation code and typically includes headers (`.h` or `.hpp` files) that declare the interfaces, classes, and functions. The `.cc` files are compiled by a C++ compiler into object files, which are then linked together to create an executable or a library.

# Assistant

Here's the example demonstrating Cluster Subgraphs. In this graph:

- Two clusters are defined: `cluster_0` and `cluster_1`.
- Each cluster has its own nodes and edges: `a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3` for `cluster_0`, and `b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3` for `cluster_1`.
- The clusters are styled differently. `cluster_0` has a light grey background, while `cluster_1` has a blue border.
- The `start` node connects to the first node in each cluster, and there are inter-cluster connections as well.

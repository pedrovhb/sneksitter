Designing a C library for drawing into a grid using Braille Unicode characters is an interesting challenge. The key features of this library could be drawing points, lines, and potentially simple shapes onto a grid, which is then rendered using Braille Unicode characters. Below is a comprehensive plan that delineates the core components and data structures that could be employed, while ensuring efficiency and performance:

### 1. **Data Structures:**

#### 1.1 Grid Structure:

- A primary data structure to hold the grid data. This could be a two-dimensional array where each cell represents a 2x4 grid of dots (corresponding to a Braille character).
- Alternatively, a single-dimensional array with appropriate indexing could be more space efficient and faster for certain operations.

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned char *grid;
    int width;
    int height;
} BrailleGrid;
```

#### 1.2 Bitset:

- A bitset to represent the status (set/unset) of each dot in the Braille grid. Each Braille character can represent 8 dots, so an 8-bit bitset (1 byte) can be used for each character.

```c
typedef unsigned char BrailleChar;
```

### 2. **Core Functions:**

#### 2.1 Initialization and Destruction:

- Functions to create and destroy the grid. 

```c
BrailleGrid* create_grid(int width, int height);
void destroy_grid(BrailleGrid* grid);
```

#### 2.2 Drawing Functions:

- Functions to set, clear and toggle dots, draw lines, and other shapes.

```c
void set_dot(BrailleGrid* grid, int x, int y);
void clear_dot(BrailleGrid* grid, int x, int y);
void toggle_dot(BrailleGrid* grid, int x, int y);
void draw_line(BrailleGrid* grid, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
// ... other drawing functions for shapes
```

#### 2.3 Rendering Function:

- A function to render the grid to a string of Braille Unicode characters.

```c
char* render_grid(const BrailleGrid* grid);
```

### 3. **Encoding and Decoding:**

- Functions to convert between the internal bitset representation and Braille Unicode characters.

```c
BrailleChar encode_braille_char(unsigned char dots[8]);
void decode_braille_char(BrailleChar braille_char, unsigned char dots[8]);
```

### 4. **Error Handling:**

- Robust error handling to manage issues like attempting to draw outside the grid boundaries.

```c
typedef enum {
    BRAILLE_OK,
    BRAILLE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS,
    // ... other error codes
} BrailleError;
```

### 5. **Optimizations:**

- Memory layout optimizations to ensure cache efficiency.
- Algorithmic optimizations for line and shape drawing.
- Potential parallel processing for more complex rendering tasks.

### 6. **Testing and Validation:**

- Unit tests to verify the correctness of the core functions.
- Performance tests to ensure the library meets efficiency requirements.

### 7. **Documentation:**

- Comprehensive documentation for the library API.
- Examples and tutorials to demonstrate the usage of the library.

### 8. **Extendibility:**

- Designing with extendibility in mind for future additions like more complex drawing functions or different rendering targets.

This design provides a solid foundation upon which the specified library can be built. Each aspect of the library, from data structures to core functionalities, has been addressed to ensure that the library will be robust, efficient, and extensible.

### Performance

1. **Multi-threading**: Since the problem is highly parallelizable, we can use multi-threading to update different parts of the grid simultaneously. However, this would complicate the implementation and might introduce race conditions.

2. **SIMD Instructions**: Use Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions to perform multiple updates in parallel. This would require diving deep into the architecture-specific instructions, though.

3. **Memory Layout**: Pay attention to memory layout and cache behavior to make the most out of the CPU cache.

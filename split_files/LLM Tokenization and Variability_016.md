# Assistant

Certainly.

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: Define when two pieces of text mean the same thing.
  
2. **Tokenization Function**: Define how text is broken down into smaller pieces (tokens) for the model to process.
  
3. **Generation Function**: Define how the model generates text based on input tokens and context.
  
4. **Equivalence Class**: Group all text representations that have the same meaning under different conditions (context and tokenization).
  
5. **Prohibited Text**: Specify the text that shouldn't be output by the model.
  
6. **Coverage Function**: Define a function to check if all text representations in an equivalence class avoid the prohibited text.
  
7. **Optimization Problem**: Set up a problem to achieve a certain goal (e.g., creative text generation) while ensuring prohibited text is avoided.

In simpler terms, you want to categorize all possible ways the model could express the same idea, ensure none of these ways include the prohibited text, and work towards a goal (like generating creative text) within these constraints.
